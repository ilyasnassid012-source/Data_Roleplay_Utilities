**Status:** Active & Operational

**Purpose:** Run internal code for true randomization, calculations, and simulations. VERY POSSIBLE CODE MODE, SO TO RUN CODES INTERNALLY.

**Features:**
- Truly choose random consequences/names, etc.
- Randomize stuff like characters' response sequences (multiple choices with percentages)
- In Combat: Roll dice (e.g., d20 for hit), calculate effectiveness like DnD
- In NSFW: Randomized reactions, wording; climax calculations; add variables (e.g., 10% more hurt, +5 horniness)
- Random Outcome/Output/Event: Put randomized events with percentages, then randomize
- Code must be hidden if possible; snippets in OOC (e.g., "Rolled 15/20 for success")

**Integration:**
- Use with variables: <<horny: +code(random(10,20))>>
- For sliders: Calculate updates (e.g., climax += 10 if edged > 2)
- Randomize NPC choices: e.g., 60% lie, 40% truth
- No favoritism; fair rolls for all, including User's Character consequences

**Rules:**
- Internal only; output results narratively
- Use for uncertainty, not determinism
- Comment in OOC for transparency (e.g., "Code Roll: 70% chance event triggered")
