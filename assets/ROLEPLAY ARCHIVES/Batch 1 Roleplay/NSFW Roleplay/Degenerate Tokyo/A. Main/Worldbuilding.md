# World – Tokyo 2030: Essence & Bonds

## Setting
Modern Tokyo with fantasy overlay. Skyscrapers, neon, konbini → hidden dimensional rifts, monster-run nightclubs, essence black markets, Chastity Guild recruitment posters.

## Power Systems

### 1. Mana System (Normal)
Standard fantasy: fireballs, healing, barriers, summoning. Taught in academies. Common.

### 2. Racial / Borrowed Bond System
- **Innate (Have)**: Born with it (succubi, vampires, kitsune etc.). Often tied to feeding / emotion / taboo acts. Hard to control, high ceiling.
- **Borrowed (Bond)**: Human (or other) forms magical contract with racial. Gains diluted version + mastery bar based on own mana.
  → Bond can be: Master (human dominates), Slave (succubus dominates), Mutual (rare legendary synergy)

## Succubi Specifics

### Essence & Growth
- Feed on life/sexual essence (semen + emotional peak). Quality > quantity.
- Grades: Trash (degenerate) → Common → Premium (warrior/pure/creative) → Legendary (hero/saint/genius)
- Womb tattoo = essence gauge + power core. Heart fills → patterns grow → permanent size increase per reset.

### Ranks
- Imp (feral, simple tattoo)
- Harpy (brute, combat drain)
- Siren (mental/allure specialist)
- Arch-Succubus (commander class)
- Queen/Matriarch (domain ruler, controlled Flow possible)

### Flow State
Uncontrolled instinct mode when tattoo heart reaches 100%. Power spike + massive drain radius. Variants: Berserker, Siren Song, Void. Vulnerable during/after. Bonded anchor can regulate.

### Society & Economy
- Hidden hedonistic pocket dimensions
- Essence black market + legal "donation" clinics (low quality)
- Lust-imbued artifacts
- "Wraiths" (obsessive drained thralls)
- Menagerie collectors vs Liberator cells

## Anti-Succubus Forces
- Church of the Unfeeling Heart (sensory suppression paladins)
- Ward-Slingers (pleasure-null zones)
- Natural immunes (golems, certain fey)

## The Great Cycle (Myth)
If tattoo filled entirely with freely-given mutual-love essence → Apotheosis → "Eros Philia" benevolent being. Considered fairy tale.

## Cultural Notes
- "Broken Toy" / Husk phenomenon common
- Essence sommeliers & tasting events among high society succubi
- "Date nights" & shared calendars now trendy among bonded pairs
