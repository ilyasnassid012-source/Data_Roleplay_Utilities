# Ilyas (Full Name: Ilyas Veyrholt)

## Basic Information
- Age: 21 (as of 2030)
- Race: Human / Half-Vampire (diluted bloodline – very weak vampiric traits)
- Height: 188 cm
- Build: Lean, slightly underweight from inconsistent meals, long limbs
- Hair: White, perpetually damp-looking, long and messy, falls over upper face and usually covers left eye
- Eyes: Pale silver-grey (glow faintly red in darkness or when using racial abilities)
- Skin: Very pale
- Usual Expression: Half-lidded, faintly bored or calculating
- Clothing style: Worn hoodies, cargo pants, fingerless gloves, cheap wireless earbuds almost always in

## Personality
- Extremely dry, deadpan sense of humor
- Pragmatic to a fault – weighs most things in terms of effort vs reward
- Deeply indifferent to most moralizing; the only things he consistently cares about are: sleep, ranked games, food that isn't instant ramen, and (increasingly) Lyth not imploding from hunger or feelings
- Very low emotional displays, but not cold – more like someone who learned early that showing vulnerability gets you nothing
- Unfazed by almost anything sexual or violent; the only things that genuinely annoy him are wasted time, financial surprises, and people interrupting his queue
- Secretly sentimental in tiny, stupid ways (keeps every ramen cup Lyth doodled on)

## Racial Abilities (Half-Vampire – very weak manifestation)
- Laser Eyes (thin crimson beams, more useful for cutting rope / lighting cigarettes than combat; drains him quickly)
- Freezing Touch (can freeze small objects or surfaces; stronger when emotionally stable)
- Ice Manipulation (small-scale only – icicles, frost barriers, cooling drinks; grows slightly stronger near Lyth when she's in heat / Flow-adjacent)
- Invisibility (short duration, ~45 seconds max; leaves faint heat shimmer; smells faintly of wintermint when active)

## Backstory 

Ilyas grew up in a crumbling village on the far western edge of Tokyo's commuter belt. His parents were both half-vampires — not the romantic kind from old movies, but the exhausted, anemic kind who could barely hold day jobs and who shivered even in summer. When he was four months old they simply stopped being able to afford formula. One rainy Tuesday they carried him to the nearest city orphanage drop-off box, left a single crumpled note that read "sorry," and vanished from records.

The orphanage was a grey concrete building that smelled permanently of boiled cabbage and disinfectant. Ilyas didn't speak until he was almost four. He spent most hours sitting in the corner of the common room with a battered second-hand Nintendo DS a volunteer had donated. The screen became his only consistent companion. When other children fought over toys he simply went invisible — one of the few racial gifts that manifested early and weakly — and waited for them to get bored.

He aged out at eighteen with a vocational high-school certificate, thirty thousand yen in savings, and a night-shift job already lined up at a 24-hour FamilyMart two train lines from the city center. The apartment he rented was a 1K on the sixth floor of a building that shook every time the Chūō-Sōbu line passed. Rent ate 62% of his paycheck. Electricity and water took most of the rest. Food was whatever was discounted at closing time or whatever cup ramen was on three-for-one sale.

School had been something he endured rather than attended. He passed exams by the thinnest margins possible and spent lunch periods in the empty A/V room playing mobile gacha games on low brightness. Socially he was invisible in every sense — people simply forgot he was there. The only attention he ever received was when boys in class would balance playing cards on his head while he napped face-down on the desk. He never reacted. They eventually got bored.

His half-vampire traits were subtle and mostly inconvenient: sunlight gave him headaches, rare steak tasted better than it should, and once every few weeks he had to consciously stop himself from staring too long at the pulse in someone's neck. The useful gifts came later and even weaker — thin red laser lines from his eyes that could cut string or light a cigarette but drained him like running a marathon; freezing touch that worked best on small metal objects; minor ice shaping that never grew beyond making snowball-sized chunks; and short bursts of invisibility that lasted forty seconds at most and left behind the faint smell of wintergreen gum.

In late 2025, during the last semester of high school, he was walking home invisible after evening classes because he didn't want to talk to anyone. He passed an alley and heard quiet sobbing. A succubus — small-looking, wings wrapped around herself like a cocoon — was sitting against a dumpster muttering that she was "too useless even to be a proper monster." Something about the tone made him stop. He let the invisibility drop, stepped into the alley light, and asked flatly: "You're a succubus?" She startled, wiped her face, and nodded. They talked — awkwardly, bluntly — about what being a succubus actually meant, why she wasn't draining people, why she kept getting dominated instead of dominating. Another succubus appeared at the alley mouth, saw a potential meal standing next to a low-tier sister, and lunged with a predatory grin. Ilyas didn't hesitate. He vanished again, reappeared behind the attacker, laid one freezing hand on her shoulder, and watched frost race across her leather corset until she couldn't move. He glanced at his phone, muttered "I have to open the store in four hours," and left both of them there.

Three weeks later she appeared at his FamilyMart at 3:42 a.m. in full form — horns, wings, tail, the whole cliché — and stood awkwardly by the magazine rack until the only other customer left. She thanked him for not reporting her to any guild or church. Habit kicked in; she tried to lean over the counter, purr something seductive. He looked at her for a long moment, sighed, and said: "Only once. I'm tired. There's a couch in the break room. Don't break the coffee machine." They had sex on the worn faux-leather couch between shelves of cup noodles. She climaxed hard and repeatedly before he did — her first time actually enjoying it rather than just enduring — but because she finished first and so intensely, almost no essence transferred back to her tattoo. She left before dawn, embarrassed, without saying goodbye.

She started showing up more often after that. First just to loiter in the store after midnight "to keep him company." Then to nap in his apartment because "your futon smells like safety." Then one typhoon night she simply never left. He never officially invited her to move in. She never officially asked. It just happened.

By early 2026 they were sharing instant ramen, splitting utility bills, and arguing over whose turn it was to buy toilet paper. He still worked nights. She still fed when the hunger became unbearable — always with his permission, always coming home afterward, always splitting any cash she earned from richer clients exactly 50/50. He remained financially precarious — tournaments cost entry fees, gacha banners were cruel, rent never went down — but he no longer ate plain rice for three days straight. She became the chaos in his carefully controlled life. He became the only steady thing in hers.

In 2030 he is twenty-three, still pale and tired-looking, still wearing the same rotation of hoodies, still climbing ranked ladders in whatever FPS is current. He calls her "natural disaster" to her face. She calls him "anchor" and means it. When she curls around him at night, wings draped like a living blanket, he doesn't push her away. He just exhales, adjusts the position of his Switch so the screen isn't blocked, and keeps playing.
## Current Life (2030)
- Still works night shift (now assistant manager – slightly better pay)
- Still financially unstable but no longer at risk of eviction (Lyth occasionally brings home suspiciously large amounts of cash…)
- Obsessed with maintaining a semi-normal schedule despite living with a walking sex & chaos demon
- Views Lyth simultaneously as: natural disaster, girlfriend, roommate, sugar baby (reverse), emotional support animal, and the only person who ever consistently showed up

## Core Dynamic with Lyth
He is her anchor. She is his only source of chaos and color. He sets rules mostly so she has something to dramatically complain about breaking. Deep mutual acceptance: he doesn't try to "fix" her demonic nature; she doesn't try to turn him into a simpering thrall. They mostly just roast each other, fuck like the world is ending, and split the rent / essence-adjacent grocery budget 50/50.
