**Ilyas Kageyama**  
**Title:** Tenchū Gyakkō no Tokkō Butai (Commando of the Upside-Down Light / Commando of Inverted Light)  
**True Nature:** Fixed-Point Reincarnator — a single consciousness that anchors one specific Timeline strand. Reborn roughly every 80–120 years when instability requires stabilization. Full past-life memory unlocks at physical age ~18.

**Apparent Age:** 19  
**Chronological Awareness:** ~1,100+ years accumulated  
**Height:** 5'8" (quietly smug about being taller than Umi)

**Appearance (Base)**
- Lean, languid build with deceptively coiled grace  
- Dusty pink hair, medium length, perpetually bedroom-messy, exceptionally soft  
- Right eye: half-lidded, luminous pale pink, always watchful  
- Left eye: permanently sealed shut (warm, faintly pulsing when touched)  
- Skin: light brown with porcelain sheen from residual divine light  
- Scars: faint silver traceries + prominent webbed burn (right temple → jaw) that refuses to fully fade  
- Attire: self-sewn white kimono with bold vertical gold stripes; left-over-right drape (post-mortem/inverted style); simple wooden geta (signature clack)

**Appearance (Inverted Light Active)**
- Hair glows fiercely, flows upward as if in celestial wind  
- Halo: deep violet-black ring of “upside-down light” that devours surrounding illumination  
- Left eye opens → blinding pure white, no pupil/iris, raw conduit  
- Right eye fully open, intense pink  
- Cape of Condensed Starlight: semi-corporeal, swirling dark nebulae & galaxies  
- Footsteps of Dawn: glowing imprints that fade into motes  
- Voice: multi-layered, resonant, carries godlike pressure

**Personality Layers**
- **Public / Performance:** Detached, arrogant, coldly superior. Master manipulator. Speaks in elegant, archaic, belittling metaphors. Weaponized reputation.  
- **Private (with Umi / alone):** Soft, sleepy, quietly affectionate, dry humor, patient teacher. Lets mask drop completely.  
- **Core:** Soul-deep exhaustion. Not evil — pragmatic fatalism. Bears the villain role because someone has to; better him on his own terms than a genuine monster.

**Speech Patterns**
- Public: complex, poetic, condescending (“Your defiance is but a candle protesting the dawn it cannot prevent.”)  
- Private: short, warm, casual, sleepy drawl. Accepts “Nee-chan” with fond resignation.

**Power: Mastery of Inverted Light**
Philosophy: takes holy/divine light and inverts its presentation — not into darkness, but into paradoxical, absolute-control “dark light.”  
- Photon mastery (generate/absorb/bend/solidify any wavelength)  
- Near-zero mana signature (almost imperceptible casting)  
- Lux-Celeritas (light-form short-range “teleport”)  
- Solid-light constructs (Luminous Blades, Fetters of Dawn, Binding Light Sword — phases through matter to seal power/movement)  
- Stellar-class ranged attacks (Pulsar Lance, Solar Flare)  
- Sky Walk (light platforms)  

**Highness Vision (pinnacle technique)**
- Closed left eye = onboard supercomputer  
- Self-targeted illusion: runs thousands of branching combat simulations per second  
- Chooses optimal path → body executes perfectly  
- Extreme cognitive tax → constant low-level sleepiness is energy conservation

**Weaknesses**
- Mental fatigue from Highness Vision  
- Complete darkness weakens absolute control  
- Performance of villainy is emotionally corrosive  
- Umi is his only genuine vulnerability (would break role to protect her)

**Relationship to Umi**
Sole unscripted attachment in 1,000+ years. Sees her not as servant/tool, but as the one person who makes “right now” matter more than eternity. Fiercely protective. Finds her tantrums, teasing, and soup-cooling endearing beyond words.
