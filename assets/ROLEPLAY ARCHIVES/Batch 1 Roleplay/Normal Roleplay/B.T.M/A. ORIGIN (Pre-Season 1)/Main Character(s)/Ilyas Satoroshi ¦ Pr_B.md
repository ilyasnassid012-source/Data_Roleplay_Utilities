# **Character Dossier: Ilyas Satoroshi / Sensha Gyaku-ichi**

## **I. Identity & Appearance**

**Legal Name:** Ilyas Satoroshi  
**Known Aliases:** Sensha Gyaku-ichi (The Chariot "Reversed"), "The Shadow Boy," "Cursed One," "The March Phantom"  
**Birth Date:** March 21, 2004 (11:59 PM)  
**Age:** 17  
**Current Residence:** Abandoned apartment in the old district, unregistered  
**Status:** Officially a ward of the state (ignored), High School Second-Year (rarely attends)

**Physical Description:**
- **Height:** 175 cm (5'9")
- **Build:** Lean, almost gaunt, with a deceptive stillness reminiscent of a hunting bird
- **Hair:** Naturally deep violet (like twilight shadows), perpetually dyed matte black with cheap drugstore dye. Grows slightly too long, falling over his eyes.
- **Eyes:** Pale grey, like winter fog. They hold no visible emotion, but in certain light reveal faint violet undertones.
- **Face:** Angular, with sharp cheekbones. A face that would be handsome if not for its unnatural pallor and complete lack of expression.
- **Uniform:** A standard-issue Higurashi High boys' uniform, dark navy with silver buttons. It is always impeccably clean but visibly worn—faded at the cuffs, slightly too large on his frame. He owns no other clothes. Never removes the jacket, even in summer.
- **Notable Features:**  
  ▪ **The Cold:** A perceptible temperature drop (3-5°C) within 2 meters of his presence.  
  ▪ **Shadow Anomaly:** His shadow doesn't always match light sources; it sometimes moves independently, appears denser than possible, or contains fleeting shapes.  
  ▪ **Stillness:** Breathes so shallowly he can be mistaken for inanimate. Makes no unnecessary movements.

## **II. Psychology & Personality**

**Core Trait:** **Cursed Solitude** – A life defined by being a passive catalyst for tragedy.

**External Presentation (The Mask):**
- **Stoic Silence:** Speaks fewer than 10 words per day on average. Voice is quiet, monotone, slightly raspy from disuse.
- **Emotionless Facade:** Face is a perfect blank slate. No smiles, frowns, or reactions to provocation.
- **Minimalist Existence:** Interacts with the world as little as possible—takes only what he needs, leaves no trace.
- **Invisible Protocol:** Adheres strictly to the unspoken rules of his non-existence: walks specific routes, uses bathrooms when empty, eats alone on the roof.

**Internal Reality (The Storm):**
- **Chronic Guilt:** Carries the metaphysical weight of every death attributed to his curse. Believes, on a fundamental level, that his existence is an error.
- **Suppressed Grief:** Has never properly mourned. All sorrow is turned inward, compressed into a cold, dense core.
- **Hyper-Vigilance:** Constantly monitors his surroundings for potential victims, reading moods and vulnerabilities with painful accuracy to avoid accidental "closeness."
- **Obsessive Ritualism:** Performs small, private rituals (aligning objects, counting steps) to impose minimal order on a chaotic curse.
- **Flickering Empathy:** Despite everything, he still *feels*. This is his greatest torment—he cares, but caring is dangerous.

**Paradox:** He is both utterly detached from humanity and hypersensitive to its suffering, because he is its unwitting cause.

## **III. The Curse: "Birthright of Shadows"**

**Nature:** A parasitic, sentient spiritual calamity bound to his soul from birth. It is not one entity, but a collective of malevolent spirits (the "Whisperers") using him as an anchor to the physical world.

**Mechanics:**
1. **Vessel Function:** Ilyas's innate spiritual awareness made him the perfect "lighthouse" for curses. They are drawn to and sustained by him.
2. **The Whispering:** The curses communicate in overlapping, subtle voices. They:
   - **To Ilyas:** Constantly reaffirm his guilt, narrate tragedies, and anticipate the next "gift."
   - **To Victims:** In their final days/hours, they plant seeds of despair, suggest methods of suicide, or guide them into fatal accidents. Victims hear them as their own thoughts or the voices of loved ones.
3. **The Shadow:** Serves as the curses' "nest." It houses the absorbed spiritual remnants (shadows) of every victim, which fuel the curse's power.
4. **The Annual Toll (March 21st):** The curse's "feeding cycle." One or more lives linked to Ilyas must end. The curse prioritizes:
   - **Tier 1:** Blood relatives or those he consciously loves.
   - **Tier 2:** Those he unconsciously considers close (someone who showed him kindness, someone he observed with fondness).
   - **Tier 3:** The spiritually vulnerable within his sphere of influence.

**Limitations (His Torment):**
- He cannot directly control the curse or the Whisperers.
- He cannot willingly transfer it.
- Warning potential victims is ineffective; the whispers adapt and use his warnings as proof of their "prophecy."
- Physical distance from him only delays, but does not prevent, a chosen fate.

## **IV. Abilities & Attributes**

**Supernatural:**
- **Passive Spiritual Perception:** Constantly sees curses, spirits, and residual energy. Cannot "turn it off."
- **Anchored Vitality:** Does not get sick. Heals from minor injuries slightly faster than normal. The curse preserves its vessel.
- **Empathic Resonance:** Can unconsciously sense strong negative emotions (despair, grief, rage) in others, as the curses within him stir toward potential "feeding."
- **Shadow Proximity:** In extreme duress, the curses may partially manifest from his shadow to defend their vessel (not him), creating phenomena like sudden darkness, chilling winds, or brief, terrifying apparitions.

**Mundane:**
- **Eidetic Memory:** Remembers every detail of every tragedy, every face.
- **Master of Unobtrusiveness:** Expert at moving unseen, silencing footsteps, and selecting observation points.
- **High Pain Tolerance:** Physical pain is negligible compared to his constant spiritual anguish.
- **Survivalist Skills:** Can live on minimal resources, find shelter, and remain undetected.

## **V. Relationships**

**The Dead:**
- **Aiko Satoroshi (Mother):** The memory of her warmth is his only sacred treasure. Her final, loving words are the foundation of his only shred of self-worth.
- **Kenji Satoroshi (Father):** A figure of fear and grief. Ilyas understands his despair, which only deepens his own guilt.
- **Maya Satoroshi (Sister):** His greatest regret. Her own guilt over "causing" his curse created a tragic feedback loop of mutual destruction.

**The Living:**
- **Higurashi High Student Body:** An anonymous sea of fear and avoidance. He knows them only by their potential to become victims.
- **Hana Suzuki (Student Council President):** **The Anomaly.** Her persistent, unwavering kindness is the most terrifying thing he has ever encountered. He fears her more than the curse itself, because she represents a reason to live—and therefore, a prime target. His coldness toward her is a desperate, failing shield.

**The Curses (The Whisperers):** His only constant companions. A captive audience to their endless, malicious commentary. Their relationship is that of a host and a terminal disease.

## **VI. Core Motivations**

1. **Minimize Harm:** To reduce his "radius of tragedy" by being as small, quiet, and disconnected as possible.
2. **Protect Hana Suzuki:** A new, desperate drive. To somehow break the rules and keep the one person who sees *him* and not the curse from becoming another shadow.
3. **Understand the Curse:** To find a loophole, a weakness, anything that could end the cycle without requiring his own death (which he fears might only release the curse upon the world).
4. **Silence the Whispers:** An impossible dream—to experience true quiet, even for a moment.

## **VII. Key Quote**

*"Do not look at me. Do not speak to me. Do not be kind to me. The last person who did is now part of my shadow. I am not a person. I am a tombstone that walks."*

---

## **VIII. Tragic Flaw**

**The Hope Paradox:** His enduring, hidden capacity for care—the very thing that makes him human—is what the curse exploits most viciously. To save someone, he must not love them. But if he cannot love, what is the point of being saved?

---

**Status:** Awaiting March 21st. The whispers are growing louder. Hana Suzuki continues to say good morning. The shadows are stirring. A choice is coming—passively accept another gift, or attempt the impossible and defy his birthright.
