# Season 1 Episode 0 — Lore & Memories — Origin & Threshold

## Lore

### Birthright of Shadows (Curse Cycle)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Character-specific / Forbidden Knowledge / System Rule
- Scope: Character-specific (Ilyas Satoroshi)
- Status: Altered (this cycle consumed; future uncertain)
- Time Period: Ongoing since birth (17 annual renewals completed)
- Canon Level: Absolute (mechanically enforced truth)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By:
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (full mechanical understanding)
  - Threshold Presence / B.T.M (system-level awareness)
  - Curse Entity / Handler (this cycle’s agent — now consumed)
- Unknown To:
  - Hana Suzuki (knew symptoms, not mechanics)
  - General public / classmates (perceived as “weird kid” behavior)
- Discoverable By:
  - Surviving 17+ annual renewals
  - Deliberate experimentation and observation over years
  - Direct confrontation with handler during renewal window

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected:
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (vessel / target)
  - Annual “gifts” (emotional attachments targeted)
  - Handlers / Curse Entities (one per cycle)
- Indirectly Affected:
  - Hana Suzuki (highest-priority target this cycle)
  - Classmates (entranced as ritual pressure)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
The Birthright of Shadows is a parasitic curse bound to Ilyas since birth. On March 21st each year (his birthday), it demands an emotional “gift” — typically the person closest to him in that moment — to renew its hold and sustain itself. The curse manifests through Whisperers (audible only to Ilyas), independent shadow behavior, temperature drops, and subjective perception (different observers see different levels of truth; Ilyas sees full monstrous forms).

Ilyas spent years deliberately isolating himself to starve the cycle of viable targets. On the 17th renewal, he verbally engaged the handler (“Curse-Sensei”), confirmed subjective mechanics, and deliberately shifted the “closest” designation to the handler itself by framing it as a rival. This inverted the ritual: the curse’s own shadows consumed the handler instead of a gift. The cycle was aborted for this year; Ilyas claims it is “forever” ended — untested.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Requires one emotionally significant “gift” per March 21st
- Gift priority scales with emotional proximity / attachment strength
- Subjective perception: non-vessels see normalcy; vessel sees truth
- Can be redirected if a higher-priority “closest” target is designated in the moment
- Handler must be present during renewal window
- Breaking the cycle via redirection consumes the current handler but does not necessarily destroy the underlying curse system

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- No active renewal pressure on Ilyas for the first time in 17 years
- Hana Suzuki now permanently sees true supernatural forms
- Threshold Presence / B.T.M considers the ledger “unbalanced” → forced recruitment
- Shadows currently dormant / non-hostile in lair
- Future cycles may adapt, escalate, or send new agents

### Beyond The Matter (B.T.M) Recruitment Threshold

#### Meta-Data
- Type: System Rule / Faction-based / Cosmic Mechanism
- Scope: Multiversal / Hub-level
- Status: Active (Ilyas now inside system)
- Time Period: Timeless (outside conventional time)
- Canon Level: Absolute (enforced by Threshold Presence)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By:
  - Threshold Presence
  - Lyra (Guide)
  - All active Chosen / Pillars (presumed)
- Unknown To:
  - Ilyas (prior to threshold encounter)
  - Hana Suzuki
  - Normal world inhabitants
- Discoverable By:
  - Breaking local supernatural systems severely enough to unbalance ledger
  - Being forcibly pulled through threshold door

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected:
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (newly recruited Chosen)
  - Lyra (assigned Guide)
- Indirectly Affected:
  - Hana Suzuki (left behind in original timeline)
  - Original timeline (temporarily safer without Ilyas as vessel)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Beyond The Matter is a multiversal organization / system that monitors and collects individuals who severely disrupt local supernatural economies (curses, cycles, pacts, etc.). When a ledger becomes critically unbalanced (17 refusals + 1 consumed handler), the Threshold Presence intervenes. It offers no true choice: accept recruitment, choose unknown doors (potentially worse), or remain in timeless void (eventual forced exit by unknown entity).

Ilyas chose the highlighted door → direct transition to personal Chosen Lair. Recruitment is framed as consequence, not reward.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Recruitment triggered by extreme ledger imbalance
- Threshold offers three paths (one highlighted “offer”, others unknown, stay = time-dilation trap)
- Chosen receive private lair, Guide, and Key (purpose unstated)
- Time dilation: subjective centuries possible without physical aging
- No immediate escape once inside without system approval

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Ilyas physically removed from original timeline
- Lair initialized; zero-gravity rest permitted
- Lyra assigned as Guide; no broadcast / Pillar surveillance yet
- Original timeline temporarily free of curse pressure

## Memories

### Memory — The Gate Farewell

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Shared / Emotional
- Emotional Weight: High
- Reliability: Accurate (fresh)
- Time Reference: March 21st, 08:05

#### Participants
- Experienced By:
  - Ilyas Satoroshi
  - Hana Suzuki
- Witnessed By:
  - None
- Remembered By:
  - Both (Ilyas currently asleep; Hana awake)
- Forgotten By:
  - None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas (calm, peaceful, head-down relief)
- Emotional Bias: Hana — protective warmth, quiet determination; Ilyas — exhausted gratitude, fragile hope

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
At the school gate, Hana stops at the boundary as promised. She delivers a soft “Happy birthday, Ilyas-kun,” acknowledging the date positively for the first time in his life. She promises to see him tomorrow and, if he disappears, she will come find him. Ilyas walks away under cherry blossoms, head down, feeling calm and peaceful for once.

Ilyas remembers the weight lifting slightly; Hana remembers the resolve to not let him vanish again.

#### Consequences
- Ilyas: First positive birthday memory; subconscious permission to rest
- Hana: Permanent supernatural awareness + emotional anchor to Ilyas
- Relationship: Isolation broken → mutual promise of reconnection

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Ilyas: May dream of cherry blossoms / gate moment during rest
- Hana: Will notice his absence tomorrow → potential search begins
- Motivates Ilyas (subconsciously) to eventually find way back or contact her

### Memory — Cheek-Puff Sleep Observation

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal (Lyra)
- Emotional Weight: Medium (for Lyra — rare genuine warmth)
- Reliability: Accurate (fresh)
- Time Reference: March 21st, 08:16–present (subjective)

#### Participants
- Experienced By:
  - Lyra (observer)
- Witnessed By:
  - None (private lair)
- Remembered By:
  - Lyra
- Forgotten By:
  - None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Lyra (softening mask, internal conflict)
- Emotional Bias: Surprise → warmth → guilt (protocol violation)

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Lyra watches Ilyas float into zero-gravity rest. She notices his hair has reverted to natural violet (no longer dyed black). As he sleeps, his cheeks rhythmically puff out and sink with each breath — an unconscious, vulnerable, adorable habit.

Lyra internally admits it’s “cute,” feels warmth in her chest, and recognizes this as dangerous for a Guide. She continues watching quietly, mask slipping in private.

#### Consequences
- Lyra: First crack in performative persona; potential attachment forming
- Future dynamic: May become more protective than protocol allows

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Lyra remains present, silent, watching over sleeping Ilyas
- Softens her future interactions (subtle)
- Possible trigger for later emotional conflict / deviation from standard Guide behavior
