## Detailed Scene Documentation

### Scene 1 — [Combat / Action] — "Window Breach & Initial Disruption"

#### Scene Metadata
- **Scene Type:** Combat / Action (breach + initial skirmish)
- **Primary Participants:** 
  - Ilyas Sokara — Initiator / Aggressor
  - Lord Veyris — Host / Primary Target
  - Head Slaver — Secondary Target / Commander
  - Hall Guards (6) — Enforcers
  - Party Guests — Observers / Panic Element
  - Bound Slaves (23, including Akane) — Witnesses / Future Beneficiaries
- **Location:** Veyris Mansion Grand Hall (marble floors, chandelier, tapestries, balcony over river)
- **Time Context:** Moonrise — immediately after path confrontation
- **Duration:** ~2–3 minutes in-universe
- **POV(s):** Primarily Ilyas (external action focus)
- **Tone/Atmosphere:** Sudden violence, shock, decadent space turned battlefield

#### Pre-Scene Context
Ilyas has discovered his own hidden river mansion is being used by Lord Veyris for a depraved slave party. After bumping nobles on the path and muttering threats, he throws two unconscious nobles through the grand hall window as dramatic entry. The party is in full swing—music, wine, chained slaves along walls, Veyris holding a chained victim, head slaver managing collars/bidding. Guards are posted but absent from perimeter (prior unseen takedown implied). Stakes: Ilyas reclaims his home, frees slaves, punishes usurpers. He knows this is his residence (paid to protect during imprisonment); no one else does.

**Character States Entering:**
- **Ilyas Sokara:** Physically fresh from release, mentally furious over home violation, Nullification Zone (unfocused) already active, aura beginning to void.
- **Lord Veyris:** Confident host, holding chain, Celestial prototype ready, believes mansion is his for centuries.
- **Head Slaver:** Professional, whip in hand, collars under control.
- **Hall Guards:** Armored, swords drawn, mana-enhanced.
- **Bound Slaves (incl. Akane):** Collared, hopeless, Akane recognizes Ilyas instantly.

#### Full Scene Narration

##### Opening Beat
Glass explodes inward—shards rain like deadly snow across marble. Two bodies (silk-clad noble & armored companion) hit floor hard—unconscious, bleeding from heads. Music stutters to silence. Wine glasses freeze mid-raise. Guests turn as one. Veyris’s smile falters—eyes narrowing at the broken window. Ilyas pops his head through shattered frame—half-lidded eyes, widening grin.

Ilyas (mocking): “But Nobody Came.”

##### Progression — Turn 1
Veyris (velvet, edged): “...And who exactly invited the entertainment through the window?”

Head Slaver (barking): “Guards! Secure him. Gently. Lord wants him breathing.”

Six armored guards rush from side doors—swords drawn, mana flaring in palms. Guests back away—silk rustling. Bound slaves tense—chains rattle. Akane’s eyes lock on Ilyas—hope flickering behind shame.

##### Progression — Turn 2
Ilyas steps fully inside—casual landing, no stumble. Grins wider.

Ilyas (grinning): “Hope you Know How to swim. Since we Going For a lesson.”

He glances around—sees slaves, notices Akane trying to look away (embarrassed). Calm, thoughtful, holding laugh:

Ilyas: “uh..., how many is now? In total.”

##### Progression — Turn 3
Akane (instant whisper): “Twenty-three... total... twenty-three of us...”

Head Slaver (whip cracking): “Silence!”

Veyris (cold): “Let him speak. I want to hear how many he thinks are here... before we show him.”

##### Progression — Turn 4
Ilyas (grinning): “Plot Twist. This Place Is Mine, Officially Registered, and You are the Tresspaser.”

Laughter erupts—cruel, incredulous. Guests exchange glances. Veyris’s smile twists.

Veyris (amused): “Yours? Officially registered? Charming delusion.”

Head Slaver (mocking): “He thinks he's the owner! Guards—subdue him.”

##### Progression — Turn 5
Guards charge—mana flaring red in palms. Firebolts form—hissing projectiles streak toward Ilyas.

Ilyas (calm): “Magic Is Overatted.”

Firebolts land—then fizzle into nothing. Mana dissipates like smoke in void. Collars on slaves flicker—then dim. Guards stumble—enchantments dying.

Ilyas (mock gentle): “What wrong?.. Did you Forget How to Use Magic?.”

##### Climax / Peak Moment
Ilyas closes eyes—then opens them. Void intensifies—rings spin to head, trails/clones multiply. One step—ground presses. He launches—blur of violet and void. Veyris’s arm caught—steel grip on silk. Pulled. Thrown. Veyris crashes into wall under broken window—stone cracks, dust falls. Chain slips free.

Ilyas (to Veyris): “What about The Swimming Lesson, do you know how?.”

Head slaver lunges—blade raised. Ilyas catches arm, spins, throws him atop Veyris—both tumble. Guards charge—Ilyas dodges, makes two collide (metal clangs), blocks one sword with leg, kicks second leg instantly—guard drops.

##### Resolution / Aftermath
Ilyas stands—hands in pockets. Grinning.

Ilyas: “Too Dependant Of Magic I see, that makes this much easier.”

He claps once—Focused Nullification surges. All non-slaves collapse unconscious—mana-dependent bodies shut down. Hall falls silent except slave breathing.

Ilyas (to slaves): “All done, Free at last.”

He proceeds—breaks remaining collars. Reassures Akane. Tells slaves to leave kingdom, seek villages (mention him & cheetah lady). Asks who wants to drop bodies in river (already done). Akane stays. Others depart gratefully.
