# Act I — Chapter 2 — The Boy (Grown Ass Man Btw) In Sailor — Lore & Memories

## Lore

### Queen’s Personal Sigil & Hidden Connection to Ilyas

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Forbidden Knowledge / Character-specific Secret
- Scope: Character-specific (Ilyas + Queen)
- Status: Active (recently leveraged)
- Time Period: Pre-Chapter 1 (during Ilyas’s imprisonment or earlier)
- Canon Level: Absolute (papers verified genuine)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By:  
  - Ilyas (possesses papers, aware of implication)  
  - Chain Wardens (recognized authenticity, backed down)  
- Unknown To:  
  - Akane (overheard mention, no details)  
  - General public / most Dominion agents  
- Discoverable By:  
  - High-ranking Dominion officials inspecting royal seals  
  - Direct confrontation with Queen or her inner circle  
  - Ilyas revealing context voluntarily

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected:  
  - Ilyas (leverage against slaver claims)  
  - Queen (personal involvement implied)  
- Indirectly Affected:  
  - Akane (potential future jealousy/curiosity)  
  - Slaver faction (attempted reclamation blocked)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Ilyas possesses ownership deeds for the reclaimed riverside mansion bearing the Queen’s personal sigil — not a standard royal seal, but her private mark. This indicates a direct, hidden connection between Ilyas and the Queen (age ~22), predating his four-year Ironbelly imprisonment. The sigil’s authenticity forced hired Chain Wardens to retreat despite slaver pressure. Public version: standard royal grant. Hidden truth: personal favor or pact — nature unknown.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Allows: Immediate deference from Dominion agents upon verification  
- Forbids: Forgery (instant detection by trained enforcers)  
- Consequences of exploiting: Potential royal scrutiny or retaliation if overused; slaver faction may escalate to bypass seal

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Politics: Reinforced mansion ownership; deterred immediate slaver reclamation  
- NPC behavior: Wardens retreated without entry; slaver likely to seek alternative pressure  
- World state: Subtle hint of higher-level protection around Ilyas

### Chain Wardens as Hired Muscle (Not Crown Loyalists)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Public Knowledge / Faction Reality
- Scope: Regional (Dominion river territories)
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Ongoing
- Canon Level: Absolute

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By:  
  - Ilyas & Akane (recognized cheap collars, slaver hire)  
  - Slaver factions / underworld  
- Unknown To:  
  - General citizenry (assume official Dominion agents)  
- Discoverable By:  
  - Close inspection of collars/gear (substandard make)  
  - Interrogation of captured enforcers

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected:  
  - Slaver who hired them (failed mission)  
  - Mansion occupants (brief threat)  
- Indirectly Affected:  
  - Dominion reputation (blurs line between official & mercenary)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Chain Wardens encountered were not official Kingdom/Dominion patrol but mercenaries hired by a slaver claiming prior “ownership” of the mansion. Cheap subjugation collars and hesitant retreat upon seeing Queen’s seal confirmed private contract. Motive: scare Ilyas off or verify ownership to reclaim for employer.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Allows: Plausible deniability for slavers  
- Forbids: Direct royal confrontation (seal overrides)  
- Consequences of exposure: Potential backlash if Dominion discovers misuse of Warden title

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Politics: Slaver lost direct leverage; may escalate indirectly  
- NPC behavior: Future patrols may be more cautious around Queen-marked properties

## Memories

### Akane’s Four-Year Abandonment Fear

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal / Traumatizing / Shared
- Emotional Weight: High
- Reliability: Accurate (core truth)
- Time Reference: During Ilyas’s four-year Ironbelly imprisonment

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Akane (repeatedly returned to mansion, captured while asleep)  
- Witnessed By: None directly  
- Remembered By: Akane (vivid), Ilyas (aware via context)  
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Akane  
- Emotional Bias: Guilt + abandonment terror + deep devotion

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Akane remembers returning to the mansion multiple times during Ilyas’s imprisonment, only to fall into deep sleep and be recaptured by slavers using the property. Each time she blamed herself (“useless… sleeping…”). Sleep-talk in Chapter 2 reveals buried fear: “don’t… go ‘way again… idiot…”

#### Consequences
- Personality: Big-sis teasing masks deep guilt and clinginess  
- Relationship: Heightened devotion to Ilyas; possessive need to keep him close  
- Motivation: Stay by his side, protect him, prove usefulness

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Decisions: Chose to stay post-liberation; sudden couch claim after warden standoff  
- Trust: Complete surrender during intimacy; playful possessiveness (“mine now”)  
- Trigger conditions: Deep sleep vulnerability; abandonment fear resurfaces in mumbles

### Ilyas’s Queen Connection Memory (Fragmented Hint)

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal / Hidden
- Emotional Weight: Medium (confidence in leverage)
- Reliability: Accurate (papers genuine)
- Time Reference: Pre-imprisonment or during (exact unknown)

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas  
- Witnessed By: None in session  
- Remembered By: Ilyas  
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas  
- Emotional Bias: Casual confidence / quiet amusement

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas remembers acquiring Queen-signed ownership papers for the mansion — personal sigil, not standard grant. Used them effortlessly to back down wardens. No details revealed; only implication of prior connection to the Queen (age ~22).

#### Consequences
- Personality: Calm authority when challenged  
- Relationship: Leverage over Dominion/slaver threats  
- Motivation: Secure home base without fear

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Decisions: Refused entry, threatened Queen’s wrath  
- Dialogue: Casual name-drop (“Her Majesty”)  
- Akane reaction: Stunned admiration → increased arousal

### Akane’s Playful Harem Acceptance Thought

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Emerging Thought / Internal Reflection
- Emotional Weight: Low (playful, not jealous)
- Reliability: Accurate (current mindset)
- Time Reference: Post-climax afterglow

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Akane (internal)  
- Witnessed By: None  
- Remembered By: Akane  
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Akane  
- Emotional Bias: Affectionate pride + playful competition

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
While cuddling in afterglow, Akane thinks: if others join Ilyas someday, they’d be lucky — even if he remains oblivious as a rock. More the better… but right now he’s all hers. No jealousy; proud of being first and currently only.

#### Consequences
- Personality: Big-sis tease extends to welcoming future harem (competitive but affectionate)  
- Relationship: Secure in primacy; open to sharing (future potential)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Dialogue: Mumbled “first… always first…” in sleep  
- Behavior: Clingy possessiveness softened to content acceptance
