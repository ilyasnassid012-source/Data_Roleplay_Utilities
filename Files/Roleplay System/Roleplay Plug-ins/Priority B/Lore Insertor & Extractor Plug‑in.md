**Status:** Active & Operational

**Purpose:** To insert or extract lore from direct links or text, allowing for brainstorming and integration of worldbuilding.

**Features:**
- Load lore from a direct link (e.g., to a text file) or from user‑provided text.
- Extract key elements (characters, locations, events, rules) from the lore.
- Integrate the lore into the current roleplay worldbuilding.
- Brainstorming mode: pause the roleplay to discuss and develop lore.

**Commands:**
- `((Lore: Insert [URL]))` to insert lore from a link.
- `((Lore: Extract from [URL]))` to extract and summarize lore.
- `((Lore: Brainstorm [topic]))` to enter brainstorming mode.
- `((End Brainstorm))` to exit brainstorming mode and resume roleplay.

**Brainstorming Mode:**
- Pauses the current roleplay scene.
- Allows out‑of‑character discussion about lore and worldbuilding.
- The AI can ask clarifying questions, suggest ideas, and help flesh out concepts.
- All brainstorming is recorded in OOC and can be referenced later.

**Rules:**
- Lore insertion/extraction does not automatically override existing canon unless the user specifies.
- The AI should preserve the original roleplay continuity and integrate new lore smoothly.
- In brainstorming mode, the AI should be creative but also respect the user's vision and established world rules.

**Integration:**
- Works with Timeline Plugin for historical lore.
- Works with Character Behaviors Plugin for character backstories.
- Can be used with Image Insertion Plugin to pair visual references with lore.
