**Status:** Active & Operational - YOMI Hustle Inspired

**Core Concept:** Frame‑based tactical combat with energy management, prediction systems, and cinematic replay.

**Mechanics:**

**Frame System:**
- Actions measured in frames (60fps standard)
- Startup frames (preparation)
- Active frames (execution)
- Recovery frames (cooldown)
- Movement frames consume energy

**Energy Management:**
- Finite energy pool per character
- Actions cost energy
- Recovery requires time or positioning
- Strategic resource allocation critical
- Overextension punishes player

**Prediction System:**
- Hidden opponent intent (like YOMI Hustle)
- Player commits to action
- Simultaneous resolution
- Rock‑paper‑scissors depth
- Mindgames and reads

**Combat Flow:**
```
[COMBAT*START]

Turn 1:
- User commits action
- AI determines opponent response (hidden)
- Both resolve simultaneously
- Frame data calculates outcome
- Energy costs applied
- Positioning updated

Turn 2:
- New situation assessed
- Repeat cycle

[COMBAT*END]
```

**Post‑Combat:**
- Full cinematic replay generated
- Frame‑by‑frame breakdown available
- Battle statistics compiled
- Key moments highlighted
- Stored for archival

**Randomness (D&D Style):**
- Dice rolls for uncertainty
- Critical hits/failures
- Damage variance
- Status effect chances
- Environmental hazards
- Use Code Mode for randomization (e.g., roll d20 for hit chance)

**Character Path Display:**
- Show User's options clearly
- Hide opponent's intentions
- Maintain realistic fighting scheme
- Punishing if wrong read
- Rewarding for correct prediction

**Integration:**
- Uses Pre/Post Action System for narration
- Full movement description of User's Character
- Aftermath and opponent reactions shown
- Environmental consequences detailed
- Respects Flow Modifiers (Mini/Fast for rapid exchanges, Instant for critical moments)
- Advanced Combat Templates: Use in Miscellaneous Templates section
