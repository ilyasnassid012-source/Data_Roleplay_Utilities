# Act I Chapter 1 — Lore & Memories — Degenerate Tokyo Starting Point

## Lore

### Degenerate Tokyo World Setting

#### Meta-Data
- Type: World Secret / Public Knowledge (hidden underbelly visible only to those in the know)  
- Scope: Global (focused on Tokyo as epicenter)  
- Status: Active / Ongoing  
- Time Period: 2030 (near-future alternate timeline)  
- Canon Level: Absolute (core setting truth)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Essence-users, succubi/incubi, black-market clinics, certain yakuza factions, Church of Purity operatives  
- Unknown To: General civilian population, most salarymen, surface-level authorities  
- Discoverable By: Witnessing essence drain, entering rift zones, contracting with demons, black-market exposure

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Essence-dependent beings (succubi like Lyth), half-breeds (Ilyas), black-market essence traders  
- Indirectly Affected: Entire Tokyo underclass, corporate elite hiding essence addiction, Church hunters

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Tokyo 2030 is a bifurcated city: gleaming corporate towers above, degenerate essence economy below. Essence is a tangible metaphysical substance — life force, pleasure, emotion — harvested through sex, violence, or ritual. Succubi/incubi feed on it to survive; humans can become addicted or altered by exposure. Rifts occasionally open, leaking demonic influence. The Church of Purity hunts essence users as heretics. Society pretends the underbelly doesn't exist; those who know either exploit it or hide from it.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Essence cannot be created, only transferred  
- Over-draining causes Flow State (berserk loss of control)  
- Succubi must feed regularly or weaken/die  
- Half-vampires like Ilyas have diluted traits (cold touch, minor invisibility) but human vulnerabilities  
- Public use of essence powers draws Church attention

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Politics: Essence black market funds shadow economy  
- Combat: Essence boosts physical/sexual ability but risks addiction  
- Powers: Succubi gain strength from feeding; half-vampires have passive traits  
- NPC behavior: Surface normalcy; underground hedonism and predation  
- World state: Fragile balance — one big rift or Church purge could collapse the masquerade

### Lyth-Ilyas Bond

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Character-specific / System Rule  
- Scope: Personal  
- Status: Active / Strengthening  
- Time Period: Ongoing since initial contract  
- Canon Level: Absolute

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Ilyas, Lyth  
- Unknown To: Everyone else  
- Discoverable By: Close observation of their dynamic, essence tattoo checks

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Ilyas (anchor), Lyth (bound succubus)  
- Indirectly Affected: Potential rivals or hunters sensing the bond

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Lyth (low-tier succubus) formed a deep essence bond with Ilyas (half-vampire human). The bond allows mutual essence sharing, emotional tethering, and physical codependence. Lyth feeds primarily through sex with Ilyas; he gains vitality and subtle demonic traits. The bond is near-permanent — breaking it would likely kill or cripple one or both.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Bond strengthens with repeated deep feeding (multiple loads, intense sessions)  
- Separation causes withdrawal (physical/emotional pain)  
- Bond tattoo on Lyth’s womb fills with essence; near-full = near-max corruption/level-up risk  
- Flow State risk increases with emotional spikes or starvation

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Politics: None direct — private bond  
- Combat: Enhanced stamina/recovery for both during intimacy  
- Powers: Lyth’s abilities subtly boosted near Ilyas  
- NPC behavior: Lyth extremely possessive/clingy; Ilyas quietly accepting  
- World state: Bond is their private sanctuary in degenerate Tokyo

## Memories

### First Night of Deep Bonding

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Shared / Traumatising (for Lyth) / Transformative  
- Emotional Weight: Extreme  
- Reliability: Accurate (both remember clearly)  
- Time Reference: Initial contract night (pre-chapter)

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas, Lyth  
- Witnessed By: None  
- Remembered By: Both  
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Lyth (possessive obsession)  
- Emotional Bias: Lyth — worshipful terror of loss; Ilyas — pragmatic acceptance

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Lyth first fed deeply from Ilyas during their initial contract. She nearly drained him to Flow State edge; he survived and anchored her. She remembers the terror of almost losing him, the rush of his essence, the moment she realized he was different. Ilyas remembers the cold clarity of near-death, then the strange comfort of her clinging afterward.

#### Consequences
- Lyth developed extreme separation anxiety  
- Ilyas became her sole safe feeding source  
- Mutual codependence locked in

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Drives Lyth’s clinginess and possessiveness  
- Makes Ilyas quietly protective despite deadpan exterior  
- Triggers Lyth’s mind-break faster with him

### Morning Aftermath (This Chapter)

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Shared / Transformative  
- Emotional Weight: High  
- Reliability: Fresh / Accurate  
- Time Reference: February 6, 2030 (02:45–08:15 AM)

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas, Lyth  
- Witnessed By: None  
- Remembered By: Both (Lyth intensely)  
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Lyth (possessive fixation)  
- Emotional Bias: Lyth — overwhelming love/fear; Ilyas — satisfied exhaustion

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Lyth rode him to mutual climax on the couch, carried him to bed still joined, repositioned face-to-face, dreamed of endless sex, woke to him hardening inside her, gave aggressive wake-up blowjob, took him in missionary and prone anal, swallowed one load, took two more creampies (pussy + ass), squirted non-stop, entered total mind-break. Ended with him pulling out, both holes overflowing, him suggesting breakfast/work. She clung in kitchen, kissed him goodbye, watched him leave while still leaking.

#### Consequences
- Lyth’s corruption meter near-max — bond feels eternal  
- Physical exhaustion + tenderness for both  
- Apartment in post-chaos state

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Lyth alone, possessive and waiting  
- Ilyas at work, carrying the bond’s afterglow  
- Sets tone for future reunions — deeper dependence
