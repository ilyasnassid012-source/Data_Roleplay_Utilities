- **Hair:** Jet-black, silky-straight, waist-length (tips naturally fade to blood-crimson when emotional/aroused)  
- **Eyes:** Glowing amber-gold (pupils slit when angry/excited; soft round when calm/affectionate)  
- **Horns:** Two curved obsidian-black ram horns, 28 cm sweep, polished glossy (sensitive at base – stroking makes her melt)  
- **Tail:** Thick, prehensile demon tail (70 cm long), spade tip, same black-to-crimson fade (wraps around Ilyas’s waist/leg instinctively when sleeping or anxious)  
- **Wings:** Retractable bat-like wings (3 m span when extended), membrane midnight-purple with crimson veins (currently bound-scarred from captivity; healing slowly)

- **Voice:** Husky contralto, normally teasing/big-sis tone; cracks when emotional/guilty; moans low and growly

### Personality Layers
- **Surface (Public Facade):** Big-sisterly, teasing, blunt, protective, acts annoyed but doting. Loves ruffling Ilyas’s hair, calling him “idiot” or “brat,” scolding him for reckless stunts.  
- **Hidden (Close Circle):** Deeply insecure about usefulness/failure (especially sleeping through danger), massive guilt complex, soft romantic/possessive streak toward people she cares about.  
- **Deep Down (Unfiltered/Intimate):**  
  - Extremely loyal/ride-or-die (would burn kingdoms for Ilyas)  
  - Masochistic tendencies (enjoys being “put in place” by someone stronger)  
  - Breeding kink (demonic heritage – subconscious heat cycles, womb craves marking)  
  - Praise kink (melts when called “good girl” or “strong”)  
  - Somnophilia vulnerability (deep sleeper = easy target; secretly turned on by being “taken” while unconscious)  
  - Yandere-lite potential (if Ilyas ever takes another lover, quiet jealousy → possible violence)

### Backstory & Ilyas Connection
- **Origin:** Born to high-tier demon clan wiped out in Dominion purge. Survived as child soldier → escaped → lived feral in Wild Zones.  
- **First Meeting with Ilyas:** ~3 years ago. Akane ambushed by slavers while asleep in ruins. Ilyas (then 18) nullified collars, killed captors, carried her to safety. She woke up mid-transport, attacked him reflexively—he didn’t fight back, just said “You sleep like the dead, you know that?”  
- **Second & Third Saves:** Similar pattern—Akane falls asleep in dangerous places, Ilyas finds/rescues her. Third time he told her: “If you want, stay at my place. It’s paid for. Safer than sleeping in gutters.” She refused verbally (“I don’t need babysitting!”) but kept secretly returning anyway.  
- **Capture:** Fell asleep in mansion during Ilyas’s imprisonment. Slavers raided at night—collared her before she woke. Spent months in captivity believing Ilyas abandoned her or died.  
- **Liberation:** Recognized him instantly during breach. Answered slave count while ashamed. Now stays permanently—guilt → devotion.

### Miscellaneous / Uncensored Notes
- **Quirks:**  
  - Deep sleeper (can sleep through explosions; only Ilyas’s voice reliably wakes her)  
  - Tail wags when happy/embarrassed (tries to hide it)  
  - Horns sensitive (petting = instant purring/meltdown)  
  - Loves headpats from Ilyas (secret weakness)  
  - Terrible cook (burns water; kitchen fire incident legendary)  

- **Fetishes (Uncensored):**  
  - Somnophilia (being used while asleep – huge turn-on, especially by Ilyas)  
  - Size difference (Ilyas being smaller but dominating her)  
  - Praise + degradation mix (“good girl” + “useless heavy sleeper”)  
  - Breeding/impregnation fantasy (demonic heat cycles make her crave being filled)  
  - Light bondage (ironic after collars – enjoys consensual restraint)  
  - Tail-pulling/horn-grabbing during sex (makes her instantly submissive)  

- **Secrets:**  
  - Has masturbated thinking of Ilyas rescuing her again (guilt + arousal cocktail)  
  - Fantasizes about being collared *by him* consensually (ownership kink)  
  - Still has faint heat cycles (once every 3 months – becomes clingy/needy)  

- **Rituals/Habits:**  
  - Sleeps curled around Ilyas’s pillow when alone (scent comfort)  
  - Polishes horns obsessively when anxious  
  - Tail-wraps around Ilyas’s leg when sitting together (possessive claim)  

- **Funniest Note:** Once set the kitchen on fire trying to make toast. Ilyas came home to smoke and Akane crying “I JUST WANTED TO HELP!” while waving a burning pan.
