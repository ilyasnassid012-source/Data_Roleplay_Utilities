# The Shattered Veil Universe - Complete Worldbuilding AU

## I. COSMOLOGICAL STRUCTURE

### The Three Realms

**The Mortal Realm (Genkai-sekai)**
- Physical world where humans, hybrids, and enslaved races coexist
- Magic saturates the atmosphere, creating "Essence Zones" of varying concentration
- Geography divided into human-controlled territories and "Wild Zones" where other races hide

**The Spirit Threshold (Yūrei-kyōkai)**
- Liminal space between mortality and true death
- Spirits must shed all curses and physical attachments to pass through
- Acts as both gateway and filter—corrupted spirits bounce back into the Mortal Realm
- Appears as endless misty corridors with doors leading to different afterlife destinations

**The Sealed Dominion (Fuuin-ryōiki)**
- Prison realm created by human betrayal during the "Chains of Covenant" event
- Non-mortals trapped here exist in perpetual limbo—unable to move on, forced to remain conscious
- Time flows differently; some spirits have been imprisoned for centuries, slowly going mad
- Geography mirrors the Mortal Realm but twisted, corrupted, filled with suffering

## II. HISTORICAL FOUNDATION

### The Age of Covenant (2,000+ years ago)
- Humans, spirits, and curses coexisted in relative balance
- The **Trinitarian Accords** established mutual respect and boundaries
- Spirits helped humans with magic; humans provided offerings and remembrance
- Curses were naturally occurring phenomena, managed collectively

### The Great Betrayal (1,500 years ago)
- Human mages discovered **Domination Theory**—magic could bind non-mortal entities
- The **Council of Seven Chains** performed the ritual that:
  - Created the Sealed Dominion, trapping countless spirits
  - Developed the first **Binding Collars** for physical subjugation
  - Severed natural spirit passages, forcing spirits into servitude
- Cursed beings were weaponized or enslaved using their own nature against them
- Sparked the **Century of Screams**—a hundred years of rebellion, brutally suppressed

### The Modern Era (Present Day)
- Human kingdoms dominate through military, magical, and economic superiority
- Slavery is institutionalized, with entire markets dedicated to trading non-humans
- Underground resistance movements grow stronger
- The **Hunter Wars**—constant skirmishes between human hunters and those who hunt humans

## IV. MAGIC SYSTEMS (EXPANDED)

### Power Categories

#### 1. Bounded Ability (Keiyaku-nōryoku)
**Mechanics:**

- Requires **Covenant Marks**—magical tattoos that appear during binding
- User and entity share power, creating symbiotic or parasitic relationship
- Breaking contract can cause death, insanity, or power backlash

**Contract Types:**
- **Equal Exchange**: Both parties benefit; respectful partnership (rare)
- **Dominance Pact**: User controls entity through force; entity suffers
- **Sacrifice Bond**: User offers something (lifespan, emotions, memories) for power
- **Parasitic Link**: Entity slowly consumes user's essence; temporary but powerful

**Aftermath Marks:**
- Glowing contract sigils on skin that pulse when ability activates
- Entity's features may manifest (horns, extra eyes, shadowy aura)
- Voice may overlap with entity's during peak power usage

#### 2. Born Ability (Umare-nōryoku)
**Mechanics:**
- Innate powers from bloodline, genetics, or soul composition
- Appear during childhood or puberty; strengthen with age
- Cannot be stolen or transferred (usually)

#### 3. Exterior Magic (Gaibu-mahō)
**Mechanics:**
- Power derived from enchanted objects, cursed artifacts, or magical items
- Requires specific conditions: wearing, wielding, consuming, etc.
- User has no inherent power; effectiveness depends on item and user compatibility
- Objects can be stolen, destroyed, or malfunction

**Item Classifications:**
- **Cursed Artifacts**: Powerful but corrupt user over time (whisper temptations, drain sanity)
- **Blessed Relics**: Holy items granting purification or protection
- **Alchemical Constructs**: Scientifically crafted magical tools
- **Bound Spirits**: Entities sealed into weapons/jewelry, lending their power

**Requirements Examples:**
- Must keep item in direct contact with skin

- Used in master-servant dynamics, family techniques, or emergency transfers
- User exhausts host's reserves, not their own

**Application Methods:**
- **Blood Transfusion**: Temporary sharing through mixing blood
- **Possession Protocol**: Spirit partially inhabits user to lend power

#### 5. Internal Ability (Naibu-nōryoku)
**Mechanics:**

- Most versatile but hardest to master

**Development Paths:**
- **Essence Cultivation**: Years of meditation and training to expand magical reserves
- **Cursed Consumption**: Eating/absorbing cursed objects to gain permanent abilities
- **Soul Forging**: Shaping one's own soul into a weapon or tool
- **Non-Mortal Retention**: Spirits/curses keep their last abilities after death

**Aftermath Marks:**

This universe is designed for morally complex roleplay where:
- **No side is purely good**: Resistance commits atrocities; some nobles show mercy
- **Power corrupts universally**: Even victims become oppressors if given chance
- **Survival requires compromise**: Characters must make impossible choices
- **Redemption is possible but costly**: Change demands genuine sacrifice
- **The system perpetuates itself**: Breaking free requires confronting complicity

The world is brutal, unfair, and saturated with suffering—but also contains genuine love, unexpected kindness, and the persistent hope that things could be different.
