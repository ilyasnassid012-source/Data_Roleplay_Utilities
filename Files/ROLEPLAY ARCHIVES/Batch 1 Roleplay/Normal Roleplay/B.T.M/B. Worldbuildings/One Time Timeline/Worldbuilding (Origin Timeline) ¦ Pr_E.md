# Sensha Gyaku-ichi: The Cursed Chronology

## **The Cursed Reality**
In this world, curses exist as invisible predators—malignant spiritual parasites that feed on human suffering, regret, and negative emotions. Most humans live their entire lives unaware of this shadow ecosystem. Only three types ever perceive them:

1. **The Born-Sighted:** Rare individuals who see curses from birth, often driven mad by the constant horror.
2. **The Death-Touched:** Those about to die, granted one final, terrifying glimpse as a curse claims them.
3. **The Cursed Anchors:** Beings like Ilyas, who become permanent vessels.

Magic exists—fragments of willpower made manifest—but remains largely unknown and wildly unstable. When it surfaces, it's usually mistaken for coincidence, madness, or miracle. No organized system exists to combat curses; humanity survives through blissful ignorance.

## **Full Timeline of Despair**

### **March 21, 2003 — Year 0: The Curse's Conception**
*Maya Satoroshi (17) and her friends discover a weathered board game in the crawlspace beneath the Satoroshi home. Drunk and reckless, they play "Omen's Gambit." Maya draws the "Cursed Birth" card. Laughter follows. The game is tossed back into darkness, its power already seeping into the family line.*

### **March 21, 2004 — Year 1: The First Gift**
*Ilyas is born at 11:59 PM, his first cries mingling with his mother's last breaths. His hair is an unusual, deep violet. As his father, Kenji Satoroshi, holds his newborn son, a shadow—unseen by all—detaches from the room's corner and sinks into the infant's form. The attending nurse later reports "a sudden chill" at the moment of birth. His mother, Aiko, dies of "unexplained postpartum complications" at exactly 12:01 AM, March 22nd. The first whisper is heard only by Ilyas: "Happy birthday."*

### **2004–2009 — The Whispering Childhood**
Ilyas grows in a house of grief and silence. Kenji turns to drink, blaming the "strange, quiet boy" for his wife's death. Ilyas sees them always: shapes in the corners, faces in the shadows, following, watching, *waiting*. They whisper not just to him, but through him—to the neighbor's dog that goes mad, to the old woman down the street who dies in her sleep. The shadows in Ilyas's wake grow thicker, darker, more populous.

### **March 21, 2009 — Year 5: The Second Gift**
*Kenji Satoroshi, in a drunken rage fueled by five years of grief and the increasingly oppressive atmosphere of his home, tries to strike Ilyas. A shadow peels from the boy and wraps around Kenji's wrist. To Kenji, in his final moments of sight, it appears as Aiko's face, screaming. He stumbles back, clutches his chest, and collapses. Coroner's report: "acute cardiac arrest." Ilyas, age 5, stands silently as the shadow returns to him, slightly denser. Maya, now 22 and living at home, finds them. She doesn't see the curse, but she feels its satisfaction.*

### **2009–2015 — The Orphanage & The School**
Placed with a distant, uncaring aunt, Ilyas becomes a ghost. At school, he is the boy no one sits beside, the presence that makes rooms feel colder. Children instinctively avoid him; teachers forget to call his name. His violet hair, a mark of his strangeness, is dyed a stark, flat black by his aunt. He wears the same standard school uniform every day, a fragile armor of normalcy. The curses in his shadow feast on the ambient fear and aversion he generates.

### **March 21, 2015 — Year 11: The Third Gift**
*Maya Satoroshi, now 28, has spent years researching the occult, consumed by guilt over the game. She believes she can reverse the curse. On the anniversary, she attempts a ritual in her childhood room. The curses, amused, whisper through Ilyas's shadow, twisting her protective intentions into despair. They show her visions of every death they've caused, each one echoing "your fault." She is found the next morning by Ilyas, hanging from the ceiling light, a note that simply reads: "I'm sorry I played the game." Her shadow joins the others.*

### **2016–Present — The High School Phantom**
Ilyas, now a teenager, is a monument of quiet grief. He speaks only when absolutely necessary. His uniform is worn but meticulously clean. He exists on the periphery of Higurashi High, a living bad-luck charm. Students cross the hall to avoid him; conversations die when he passes.

**The Rules of Avoidance:**
1. Do not look directly at Ilyas Satoroshi.
2. Do not speak to him.
3. Do not acknowledge his existence.
4. If he approaches, walk away.
5. Never be the last one with him in a room.

These are not written rules, but instinctual, social ones. The curses reinforce them, spreading subtle unease.

### **The Anomaly: President Hana Suzuki**
Hana Suzuki, student council president, is the sole exception. Bright, empathetic, and stubbornly principled, she sees a lonely boy, not a curse. She greets him every morning. She leaves a spare umbrella by his shoe locker when it rains. She sits across from him in the library, speaking softly about mundane things despite his silence.

The curses have taken note. They whisper to Ilyas of her kindness, her light, her *potential* as a gift. They covet her vibrant shadow. Ilyas, for the first time, feels a flicker of something beyond despair: dread. He avoids her more aggressively than anyone, his silence turning actively cold, but she persists. Her determination is a mystery to him—and a growing terror.

## **The Annual Ritual: March 21st**

Every year, the cycle renews. As the day approaches, the whispers grow louder, the shadows more restless. Ilyas's "birthday gifts" are delivered with cruel punctuality. The victims vary:
- **Loved Ones** (prioritized, as per the curse's cruel logic)
- **Those He Declares Close** (a careless word, a moment of accidental kindness received)
- **The Vulnerable** (drawn by whispers only they can hear in their final hours)

The method is always a "plausible" tragedy: accident, illness, suicide. The shadows of the departed are absorbed into Ilyas's own, expanding the curse's power and his permanent, invisible entourage.

## **Current Day: March 20th**

Tomorrow is March 21st again. The air is growing thick. The crows outside Higurashi High are silent. Ilyas sits alone on the school roof, staring at the sunset. His shadow stretches long and wrong behind him, teeming with silent, waiting shapes.

Hana Suzuki finds him there, despite the rules. "Satoroshi-kun," she says, her voice gentle against the evening chill. "It's going to be cold tonight. You should go home."

He doesn't turn. He doesn't speak. Inside, a storm rages: the memory of his mother's warmth, the guilt of every gift, the crushing weight of the curse, and a new, sharp fear—*not her, please, not her*.

But the curses are already whispering to a lonely janitor in the school basement, to a troubled first-year on the bridge nearby, and yes, faintly, into Hana's own dreams. They are setting the stage. The gifts must be given. The shadow must be fed.

Tomorrow, someone will die. The only questions are who... and whether Ilyas, for the first time in his cursed life, will find a way to break the cycle before the one person who sees him becomes nothing but another shade in his eternal, walking night.
