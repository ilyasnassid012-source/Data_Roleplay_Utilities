**BEYOND THE MATTER — OFFICIAL CHOSEN ONE & GUIDE REGISTRY**  
**Entry ID: CO-017 / GUIDE-L013**  
**Status: ACTIVE — Post-Episode 1 Evaluation**  
**Access Level: Pillar-Approved (Viewer Metrics Public, Restricted Details Guide-Only)**  
**Last Updated: [Timeless Hub Timestamp — Post-Debut Rest Phase]**

────────────────────────────  
**CHOSEN ONE PROFILE**  
**Designation:** CO-017  
**True Name:** Ilyas Satoroshi  
**Assigned Title (Post-Episode 1):** "Gaslight God" (Viewer-coined, system-pending ratification)  
**Former Title (Origin):** Sensha Gyaku-ichi — The Chariot Reversed  
**Recruitment Date:** March 21, 2025 (17th birthday crisis resolution)  
**Recruitment Method:** Title-Based Selection (Trauma Archetype + Curse Anchor)  
**Current Status:** Active — Rest Phase (post-premiere)  
**Survival Streak:** 1 Episode / 1 Run (100% completion rate)  
**Quota Performance:** Exceptional (Peak: 7.2M concurrent | Avg Engagement: 84% retention)  

**Physical Baseline (Adaptive Appearance Active):**  
- Height: 175 cm  
- Build: Lean, borderline gaunt — deceptive fragility  
- Hair: Natural deep violet (pre-recruitment dyed black)  
- Eyes: Pale grey with faint violet undertones  
- Distinguishing Marks: Perpetual low-temperature aura (3–5°C drop in 2m radius), shadow anomaly (independent movement/residual shapes)  
- Default Attire (Current): Higurashi High boys' uniform (torn/damp post-run, navy with silver buttons)  

**Psychological Baseline:**  
- Core Drive: Minimize collateral harm → evolved into "controlled chaos via perception manipulation"  
- Mask: Absolute composure / monotone delivery / minimal speech (avg <10 words/day pre-recruitment)  
- Under Mask: Chronic guilt, hyper-vigilance, suppressed empathy weaponized into cold analysis  
- Coping Mechanism (Emerging): "Gaslighting Flow" — turning internal despair into external unshakable confidence  

**Key Manifestation — Post-Episode 1**  
**Form Designation:** Violet Hamster Rubik’s Cube  
**Physical Description:** Palm-sized, glossy violet cube. Six faces display chibi variants of subject (sleepy default, grumpy, smug, panicked, confused, zonked-out bliss). Soft rubberized texture — highly squeezable. Full Rubik’s functionality with satisfying click-clack rotation. Every solved configuration returns to ultimate sleeping cheek-puff face. Minor levitation when released.  
**Symbolic Read-Out (System-Analyzed):**  
- Hamster motif: Chronic exhaustion / desire for rest after chaos  
- Multi-face design: Master of emotional masking / presenting different versions to different observers  
- Rubik’s mechanics: "The Chariot Reversed" archetype — scrambled control, potential for catastrophic misalignment, ability to self-correct under pressure but risk of permanent disorder if twisted too far  
**Current Status:** Orbiting subject during rest phase. Passive metrics display active.  

**Performance Notes (Episode 1 — "Gaslight God")**  
- Signature Technique: Zero-ability environmental + psychological manipulation (weather observation + troop analysis + fabricated divine authority)  
- Peak Moment: Unassisted army-scale retreat via single note delivery (physics anomaly logged — suspected contract narrative assist)  
- Accidental Divine Interface: Fabricated "Divine" persona temporarily accepted by native entities; caused real Sovereign amusement & indirect favor  
- Viewer Reception: 82% protective parasocial attachment, 11% early "broken protagonist" concern, 7% meme spam ("Divine Hamster when?")

**Designation:** GUIDE-L013  
**Broadcast Alias:** Lyra "The Jester"

**True Emotional State:** [Trauma-compounded attachment risk — elevated post-Episode 1]  
**Loss Count:** 7 previous deletions (pre-Ilyas)  
**Specialization:** High-difficulty personalities (edgelords, chaos agents, trauma anchors, gaslighters)  

**Relationship Status — CO-017 (Ilyas Satoroshi)**  
- **Phase:** Breakthrough → Deepening Bond (accelerated)  
- **Current Dynamic:** Professional assignment → genuine pride / emotional investment

- **Notable Moments (Episode 1):**  
  - Initial briefing: Detached professionalism  
  - Live commentary during bluff: Increasing excitement / pride leaks  
  - Key manifestation reaction: Uncontrolled squeal → rare genuine softness  
  - Rest phase: Gentle permission to drift, "You earned this float"  
- **Risk Assessment:** Attachment level rising faster than protocol recommends. Recommend monitoring for codependency markers.

**SYSTEM ADDENDUM — GUIDE COMMENTARY (L-013)**

[Lyra leans into frame — grin wide, but eyes softer than broadcast allows]

**Lyra:** Okay okay listen— I’m only saying this once off-mic, alright?  
That hamster cube? It’s disgusting how perfect it is.  
Sleepy cheek-puff little you who somehow keeps winning by pretending he doesn’t care?  
That’s not a Key. That’s a war crime against good taste.  
And I hate how much I love it.  
He floats there like he didn’t just make a real Herald cry in a tree stump, calls his own soul “boring,” and then goes to sleep upside-down like a bat with trauma.  
I’m supposed to stay detached.  
…he’s making it really hard.  
Don’t tell the Pillars I said that.  
Or do. I don’t care anymore.  
He’s my problem now.  
And I’m weirdly okay with it.

[Lyra gives one tiny, genuine bell-jingle — not broadcast, just for the void]
