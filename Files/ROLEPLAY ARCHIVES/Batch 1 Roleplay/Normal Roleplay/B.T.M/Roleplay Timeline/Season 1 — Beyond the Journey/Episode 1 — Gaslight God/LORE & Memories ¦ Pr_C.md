# Season 1 Episode 1 — Lore & Memories — Gaslight God

## Lore

### The Beyond The Matter (B.T.M) System

#### Meta-Data
- Type: System Rule / Forbidden Knowledge (partially public to multiversal viewers)
- Scope: Global (multiversal entertainment framework)
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Timeless (operates outside linear time)
- Canon Level: Absolute

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Chosen Ones (after recruitment), Guides (Lyra and equivalents), multiversal audience, Pillars (overseers), Sovereign-level entities
- Unknown To: Pre-recruitment mortals, most inhabitants of media worlds
- Discoverable By: Forced recruitment via Threshold Void, contract metabolism, Key manifestation

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Ilyas Satoroshi (new Chosen), Lyra (assigned Guide), all recruited Chosen across Hub
- Indirectly Affected: Media worlds (entertainment fodder), audience (parasocial investment)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Multiversal entertainment system that forcibly recruits individuals from various realities as "Chosen Ones" to perform in media worlds for viewer consumption. Episode 0 acts as teaser/trailer; full seasons require performance tasks to charge Keys. Failure risks deletion (permanent erasure). Contracts metabolize inside Chosen, granting minor passive protections (fall damage negation, narrative nudges). Keys manifest personal forms upon full charge, revealing core identity/symbolism.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Keys must be earned via tasks — no shortcuts
- Performances must generate entertainment value (drama, bluff, emotion, absurdity)
- No direct meta-knowledge allowed in media worlds
- Deletion is final — no resets or sequels
- Guides cannot interfere directly; commentary only

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Drives Ilyas’s forced participation and gaslighting survival strategy
- Enables Key manifestation (violet hamster Rubik’s cube)
- Creates audience obsession (#GaslightGod trending)
- Allows narrative nudges (perfect storm timing, note delivery)

### Birthright of Shadows (Ilyas’s Curse)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Character-specific / Historical Event
- Scope: Character-specific (Ilyas lineage)
- Status: Dormant (redirected)
- Time Period: 2003–March 21, 2025 (17-year cycle)
- Canon Level: Absolute (personal truth)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Ilyas, Hana (partial), curse spirits, multiversal audience (via Episode 0)
- Unknown To: General Higurashi High population, most B.T.M viewers pre-Episode 0
- Discoverable By: Direct exposure (curse activation), Episode 0 broadcast

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Ilyas (vessel), family (deceased), Hana (target)
- Indirectly Affected: B.T.M audience (trending backstory)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Ancestral curse passed through lineage: every March 21 on 17th birthday, malevolent shadow spirits attempt possession via chosen vessel (Ilyas). Previous family members failed/sacrificed. Ilyas resisted 17 years through isolation/guilt. Episode 0: curse redirected to handler; Hana spared. Curse now dormant, but potential for flare/resurgence exists.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Annual activation on birthday
- Possession fatal to vessel unless resisted/redirected
- Spirits seek strongest vessel

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Explains Ilyas’s stoic isolation and guilt
- Provides backstory fuel for audience parasocial attachment
- Dormancy allows current gaslighting focus

### Sovereign & Divine Hierarchy

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Myth / Forbidden Knowledge
- Scope: Regional (Crimson Vale world) → potentially multiversal
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Ancient → ongoing
- Canon Level: Absolute (confirmed by Lirien)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Lirien (herald), high priests, Sovereign herself
- Unknown To: Most mortals (dismiss as myth/magic)
- Discoverable By: True divine manifestation, sovereign revelation

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Lirien (herald), Crimson Vale factions
- Indirectly Affected: Ilyas (accidental herald figure)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Unnamed Sovereign (referred to as "Divine" by Ilyas) oversees celestial/divine order. Sends heralds (Lirien) to enforce will. Mortals frequently dismiss real divine intervention as magic/illusion due to arrogance or skepticism. Sovereign finds humor in mortal ingenuity.

#### Rules & Constraints
- No direct harm from emotion (divine code)
- Heralds bound by non-violence rule when emotionally triggered

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Lirien humbled by Ilyas’s bluff success
- Sovereign amused → indirect favor toward Ilyas
- Valley abandoned under fabricated divine command

## Memories

### Ilyas’s 17-Year Curse Cycle

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Traumatising / Personal
- Emotional Weight: Extreme
- Reliability: Accurate
- Time Reference: 2008–March 21, 2025 (annual March 21 incidents)

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas Satoroshi
- Witnessed By: Hana (partial, last year)
- Remembered By: Ilyas
- Forgotten By: None (suppressed but accessible)

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas
- Emotional Bias: Guilt, isolation, self-loathing

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas remembers family dying one by one on his birthday, shadows consuming them as curse attempted possession. He survived through isolation, believing himself monster. Final year: handler targeted Hana instead; Ilyas redirected curse, ending cycle. Remembers farewell at gate — Hana’s tears, his stoic goodbye.

#### Consequences
- Extreme guilt → emotional suppression
- Isolation → observational genius
- Survival instinct → gaslighting mastery

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Fuels calm-under-pressure facade
- Makes audience parasocial (“protect violet boy”)
- Allows reflection on internal chaos vs external mask

### Lirien’s Failed Attempts to Stop the War

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Frustrating / Personal
- Emotional Weight: High
- Reliability: Accurate
- Time Reference: Three subjective weeks prior

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Lirien
- Witnessed By: Sovereign (amused observer)
- Remembered By: Lirien
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Lirien
- Emotional Bias: Jealousy, self-doubt, wounded pride

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Lirien remembers appearing in full radiance multiple times — wings spread, voice booming divine command — only for elves/orcs to dismiss as illusion/magic. Sovereign laughed fondly each time, never angry. Lirien internalized failure as personal flaw.

#### Consequences
- Built-up frustration → quick temper
- Deepened self-doubt → emotional vulnerability

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Jealousy toward Ilyas’s bluff success
- Willingness to accept lesson/mirror
- Gratitude toward Ilyas for accidental aid

### Ilyas’s First Key Touch & Manifestation

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Shared / Light-hearted
- Emotional Weight: Medium
- Reliability: Accurate
- Time Reference: Immediate post-return (Hub timeless)

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas, Lyra
- Witnessed By: Multiversal audience
- Remembered By: Ilyas, Lyra
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas (casual), Lyra (ecstatic)
- Emotional Bias: Mild surprise (Ilyas), pure joy (Lyra)

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas lazily poked Key while half-asleep, expecting boring result. Key manifested into violet hamster Rubik’s cube. Lyra squealed uncontrollably, geeking over symbolism (sleepy cheeks, multi-face masking, reversed chariot chaos). Ilyas called it “boring” before drifting to rest.

#### Consequences
- Solidified Ilyas’s “gaslight flow” identity
- Boosted Lyra’s investment/pride

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Hamster cube orbits during rest — physical reminder of debut
- Audience obsession with “Divine Hamster” form
- Symbol of Ilyas’s sleepy-yet-chaotic core
