1. Soup Cooling Incident  
Ilyas returns exhausted from dealing with “hero” mercenaries. Sits. Takes one sip of scalding miso soup. Pauses. Looks at Umi standing innocently behind him.  
Ilyas (deadpan): “…Umi.”  
Umi (wide-eyed): “Yes, Nee-chan?”  
Ilyas: “My soup is now approximately the temperature of a glacier lake.”  
Umi (tiny proud smile): “It was too hot. You would burn tongue.”  
Ilyas (sighs fondly): “Next time warn me before weaponizing dinner.”  
Umi (soft echo): “…weaponizing dinner, Nee-chan.”

2. Tantrum Mode: The Missing Hairpin  
Umi cannot find her snowflake hairpin. Full stomping circuit through mansion. Tiny ice crystals trail her feet.  
Umi: “It was RIGHT HERE! Someone STOLE it!”  
Ilyas (calmly reading): “No one has been here but us.”  
Umi: “Then the house ate it!”  
Ilyas eventually finds it tangled in her own hair. Holds it up silently.  
Umi (instant deflation): “…oh.”  
Ilyas (gentle): “Come here, idiot.” Fixes it back in place. She immediately buries face in his chest.

3. “Nee-chan” Origin Fight  
Umi (reading romance scroll): “Nee-chan means big brother who protects and spoils you forever.”  
Ilyas: “I’m not your brother.”  
Umi: “But you protect. And spoil. With cake.”  
Ilyas: “…”  
Umi (grinning): “Nee-chan.”  
Ilyas (resigned, tiny smile): “You’re impossible.”

4. Quiet Night After “Villain Work”  
Ilyas returns with new frost scars on forearms from suppressing a fire-mage uprising (let them think he “stole their power”). Sits silently.  
Umi wordlessly sits behind him → rests forehead against his back → slowly lowers room temperature until his tension eases.  
Ilyas (soft): “You don’t have to do that.”  
Umi: “Want to. Nee-chan is warm. I am cold. Good balance.”

5. Training Mishap  
Umi practicing Flesh of Frost transformation. Gets stuck half-ice, half-girl — legs crystallized, upper body normal.  
Umi (panicked): “Nee-chan! I’m a table decoration!”  
Ilyas (trying not to laugh): “Hold still. Don’t move or you’ll shatter.”  
Proceeds to very carefully thaw her with controlled pulses of warm light while she grumbles in embarrassment.

6. Protective Moment (External Threat)  
Adventurer party reaches mansion gates, shouting “Light-Stealer! Surrender the beast-girl!”  
Umi steps out alone. Creates perfect 30-meter snow-squall wall. Visibility zero. Wind howls.  
Party flees.  
Ilyas (watching from balcony): “You know I could have handled that.”  
Umi (turning, hair still whipping): “I know. But they called me beast-girl. So I showed them blizzard.”  
Ilyas (quiet pride): “Good girl.”

7. Rare Vulnerable Night  
Ilyas (after particularly bad day): “Sometimes I wonder if letting the prophecy win would be easier.”  
Umi (crawls under blanket with him): “No. Because then I would be alone again. And you promised.”  
Ilyas (arms around her): “I did. I’m sorry. I won’t break it.”


8. The Romance Scroll Discovery  
Ilyas enters the library. Umi is sprawled on the rug, face buried in an illustrated volume — explicit panels clearly visible.  
Ilyas (calm): “Umi. Reading something educational?”  
Umi (snaps book shut, ears red): “It’s… cultural research! For… language!”  
Ilyas (leans over, reads title aloud): “‘The Ravishing Duke and His Secret maids — Volume 7.’”  
Umi (hides face): “Nee-chan is mean!”  
Ilyas (soft chuckle): “You’re allowed to be curious. Just don’t try page 42 on me without warning.”  
Umi peeks through fingers, mortified and intrigued.

9. Coffee Sabotage — Caught Red-Handed  
Ilyas lifts steaming mug. Takes sip. Freezes.  
Ilyas (flat): “Umi.”  
Umi (standing behind chair, innocent): “Yes, Nee-chan?”  
Ilyas: “My coffee is now slush.”  
Umi (tiny proud smile): “You always drink it too fast and burn mouth.”  
Ilyas sighs, sets mug down, pulls her into lap.  
Ilyas: “Next time ask. Or I start freezing your sweets in revenge.”  
Umi (horrified): “You wouldn’t!”

3. Bedtime Negotiation  
Umi (in doorway, blanket dragged behind): “Nee-chan. Bed is too big. Too cold.”  
Ilyas (reading in bed): “Your room has three quilts.”  
Umi (climbs in anyway): “But you’re warm.”  
Ilyas (teasing): “Is this because of those books again? Planning to ravish me in my sleep?”  
Umi (flustered squeak, stomps foot → tiny ice crackles): “No! …maybe a little.”  
She flops dramatically onto mattress, nudges closer until her cold nose presses his neck.  
Ilyas (soft laugh, arm around her): “You’re impossible.”

4. The Accidental Lap Nap  
Ilyas meditating on balcony. Umi sneaks up, curls into his crossed legs like a cat.  
Falls asleep instantly, drooling slightly on his kimono.  
Ilyas (murmurs): “You drool ice crystals.”  
Doesn’t move for two hours.

5. Jealousy Over a Visiting Merchant Girl  
Merchant’s daughter flirts shamelessly with Ilyas during supply delivery.  
Umi stands behind him, aura dropping ten degrees.  
Merchant girl shivers: “Is it… colder suddenly?”  
Umi (deadpan): “No. It’s always this temperature around liars.”  
Ilyas hides smile.

6. Shared Bath Mishap (Mild NSFW)  
Umi insists on bathing together “like family in the old stories.”  
Water freezes the moment she enters tub.  
Ilyas (trapped in ice up to waist): “Umi. Release me.”  
Umi (pouting, straddling his lap): “But now you can’t escape cuddles.”  
Ilyas (resigned, warm light slowly melting): “You’re going to be the death of me.”  
Umi (soft, sincere): “Never. I protect Nee-chan.”

7. Nightmare Comfort  
Ilyas wakes gasping from memory-dream of the village massacre.  
Umi already there, arms around him, room filled with gentle snowfall.  
Umi (whisper): “They’re gone. You’re here. With me.”  
He buries face in her hair until breathing steadies.

8. Teasing Revenge — Ice Play (NSFW)  
Umi teases him one too many times about “being old and sleepy.”  
Ilyas pins her gently to bed with light-fetters.  
Ilyas (low): “Let’s see how cheeky you are when you can’t move.”  
He trails warm fingers down her frost-marked ribs → she gasps, markings glowing.  
Umi (half-laugh, half-moan): “Nee-chan… unfair…”  
He stops just before she melts entirely.  
Ilyas: “Say sorry.”  
Umi (breathless): “…sorry… more?”

9. Morning Aftercare (Post-Intimacy)  
Sheets frosted over in delicate patterns from her loss of control.  
Umi curled against his chest, hair glowing faintly, markings still luminous.  
Ilyas traces frostbite swirls with fingertip.  
Umi (sleepy): “Did I… hurt you?”  
Ilyas: “No. You made everything quiet for once.”  
Kisses her forehead. Room slowly warms.

10. Quiet Promise Under Stars  
Watching meteor shower from roof.  
Umi: “If the world ever tries to take you away because of the prophecy…”  
Ilyas: “It won’t win.”  
Umi (fierce): “I’ll freeze the entire Timeline if I have to.”  
Ilyas (pulls her close): “Let’s not tempt fate. Just stay here. With me.”  
Umi (soft): “Always, Nee-chan.”
