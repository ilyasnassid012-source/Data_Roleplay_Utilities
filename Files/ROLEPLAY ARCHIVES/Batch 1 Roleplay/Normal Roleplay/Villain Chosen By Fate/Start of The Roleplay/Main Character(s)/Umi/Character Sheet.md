**Personality Layers**
- **Public:** Serene, untouchable, glacially neutral. Silent sentinel at Ilyas’s side/back.  
- **Private (with Ilyas):** Childish, bold, uninhibited, playful, teasing. Prone to short “Tantrum Mode” (stomping → ice crackles). Parrot-echo quirk when relaxed (“…Nee-chan.”).  
- **Core:** Deep attachment blending filial, platonic, budding romantic feelings. Fiercely protective of their small, warm world.

- Thermal reduction (passive → lethal)  
- Ice generation & shaping (delicate → structural)  
- Cryokinesis (telekinetic ice control)  
- Flash Freeze (objects/living targets)

**Weaknesses**
- Arid environments = higher drain  
- Extreme heat = discomfort/weakened output  
- Emotional instability can cause uncontrolled bursts (mostly mastered)

**Relationship to Ilyas**
He is her entire world: savior, teacher, anchor, family, safe place. She sees through his performance instinctively. Protects him in return (snow-squall incident). “Nee-chan” is both tease and deepest truth.
