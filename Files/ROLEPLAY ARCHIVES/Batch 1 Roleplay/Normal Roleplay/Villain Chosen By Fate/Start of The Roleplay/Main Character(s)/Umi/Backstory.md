**Umi — The Frost Child Who Was Never Foretold**  
**Full Origin & Emotional Documentation**

**Genesis (≈106 Years Ago)**  
A great Frost Dragon — ancient, solitary, wise — perished in a cataclysmic aerial duel above the northern wastes.  
As it fell, one tear crystallized mid-air: a perfect, opalescent droplet of draconic essence.  
It struck earth and did not melt. Over decades it drew ambient moisture and latent magic, growing into a large, frost-rimed egg nestled inside a permanent circle of hoarfrost.

**First Emergence — Age 0 (Physical Infant)**  
Fifty years later, village children discovered the “giant gem.”  
They threw stones for sport.  
One cracked the shell.  
A pulse of absolute cold exploded outward.  
From the fracture crawled a naked infant girl — pale, frostbite-patterned, eyes wide and glowing glacier-blue with fractal pupils.  
She had no language, no understanding, only instinct.  
Anything that approached with intent froze instantly in perfect, non-lethal stasis blocks.  
Wolves. Bears. Concerned villagers.  
She did not mean harm. She simply did not yet know “other living things are supposed to keep moving.”

**The Garden of Statues (Age 0–10 Chronological)**  
For a decade she survived alone.  
Drank from streams she flash-froze solid.  
Gnawed berries preserved by her own touch.  
Tore raw meat and flash-froze it mid-bite.  
Around her egg-site grew a silent ring of frozen statues — animals and people locked in mid-step, expressions of surprise or terror forever preserved.  
The local village declared the forest cursed. Entry was forbidden.  
Umi remained, trapped by her own power, surrounded by companions who could never speak back.

**First Consciousness & Sorrow (Age ≈10–15 Chronological)**  
A dim awareness bloomed.  
She began to notice patterns: approach → cold → stillness → loneliness.  
A wordless emotion took root — profound, aching sadness.  
She did not want statues.  
She wanted something warm that would not stop moving when she looked at it.  
But everything she touched became still.  
The realization crushed her: **she was the danger.**

**Self-Imposed Hibernation (Age ≈15–100 Chronological)**  
One winter morning she crawled to the center of her frost ring.  
The shattered eggshell fragments had been overtaken by a single magical flower — frost-resistant, enormous, deep-petaled.  
It felt safe.  
With a final, soundless whimper she curled inside the bud.  
Directed her power inward.  
Encased herself in perfect, timeless ice.  
Entered **Cryo-Hibernation** — heartbeat slowed to once per hour, thoughts stilled to near-nothingness.  
The flower closed protectively around her.  
The forest forgot her.  
She waited — unconsciously — for a warmth that would not demand she melt to be loved.

**The Thawing (Age 100–106 Chronological / Physical 10–16)**  
Ilyas’s ambient light — soft, pink, impossibly gentle — brushed the petals at age 15 (his).  
The flower opened.  
He carried her home.  
Endured the cold that scarred his arms rather than force heat on her fragile form.  
Sat with her in the stone pool for hours while ice crept up his chest.  
When she finally drew a full, shuddering breath, something inside her that had been waiting a century finally unclenched.

**Awakening & Re-Learning the World**  
First days: infant-like. Gurgling coos. Tried to eat bowls instead of food.  
Ilyas taught her with **Light-Scripts** — projected pictograms paired with real objects and actions.  
Her first word (pointing at him): “A…ka…ri?” (Light?)  
He corrected softly: “Ilyas.”  
First taste of warm cake → wide-eyed, reverent devouring.  
First clumsy attempt to leave → followed a bird out the gate naked. Ilyas retrieved her without anger, only a tired sigh and a blanket.  
He sewed her clothes. Taught her utensils. Showed her how to bathe without freezing the tub solid.  
When her mind caught up to her maturing body, personality emerged: curious, mischievous, bold once trust was absolute.  
The “Nee-chan” habit began as a prank from a romance scroll. It stuck because his resigned acceptance made her heart do strange, fluttering things she only half-understood.

She became his anomaly — the one being never scripted by prophecy.  
He became her entire definition of safety.
