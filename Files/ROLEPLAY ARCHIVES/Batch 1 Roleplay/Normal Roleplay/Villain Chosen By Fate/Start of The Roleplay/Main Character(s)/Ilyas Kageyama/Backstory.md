**Ilyas Kageyama — The Fixed Point of Inverted Fate**  
**Full Chronological & Emotional Documentation**

**Pre-Current Life (The Accumulated Millennia)**  
Ilyas is not reincarnated in the romantic soul-journey sense. He is a **Fixed-Point Reincarnator** — a single, continuous consciousness deliberately re-anchored by the Timeline itself whenever a critical Fracture threatens catastrophic unraveling along one specific causal strand. Each rebirth occurs roughly every 80–130 years. Memories do not trickle in gradually; at physical age ~17.5–18, the floodgates open. He wakes one morning remembering not dreams, but entire detailed lifetimes — every conversation, every death, every betrayal, every small kindness that ultimately failed to change the larger script.  
These are not emotionally “his” lives in the beginning. They feel like obsessively well-written novels starring someone who looks and sounds like him. Over centuries the boundary blurs. The weariness becomes personal.

**Current Life — Birth to Age 8 (The Village Era)**  
Born in a foothill village of mixed human and beast-kin families — a rare pocket of uneasy coexistence.  
Mother: Elara, gentle weaver with melancholy eyes and soft hands.  
Father: Kael, mid-tier adventurer who vanished on a high-pay escort contract when Ilyas was two.  
The village elders whispered the old cautionary rhyme:  
“Once gone and missed, returning brings misfortune to those who missed him.”  
Elara never searched. Fear of confirming the worst kept her silent.

Ilyas was marked early: unnaturally calm, dusty-pink hair that caught every light like rose quartz, eyes that seemed older than his body. Children called him “ghost boy.” Adults gave him wide berths. His magic manifested at five — not fireballs or wind gusts, but a soft, steady, warm glow. Useful for reading at night. Useless for impressing. He learned very young that being harmless made people more afraid, not less.

**The Fracture Event — Age 8 (Birthday Massacre)**  
Kael returned at dusk on Ilyas’s eighth birthday — not as a man, but as a walking breach. A swarm of **Crawling Curses** (semi-sentient regret parasites) had used him as a living gateway. The instant he crossed the village boundary the old superstition activated as literal prophecy.  
The curses erupted like black oil. They did not kill messily; they consumed slowly, lovingly, feeding on every unvoiced regret. Screams turned to wet gurgles turned to silence.  
Ilyas stood in the square and watched everything end. His mother — still at home icing a small honey cake — was the last to fall.  
When the swarm finally turned to him, something inside snapped awake.  
His body dissolved into light. The curses passed through empty radiance.  
Instinctively, he reached upward toward the dying sun and **pulled**.  
A nova of inverted light detonated outward. His left eye became a blinding white star; a halo — initially pure white — spun above his head. The curses vaporized. When the light collapsed, the village was ash and corpses. The halo dimmed to gold, then began its long darkening toward violet-black.  
His left eye sealed itself shut from the internal backlash, forever warm, forever calculating.

Militia from the next valley arrived at dawn. They saw one pink-haired child sitting calmly amid carnage, the faint afterimage of a halo still burning in their retinas. The old sage recited the prophecy fragment aloud.  
Verdict: instant and unanimous.  
They advanced with null-collars.  
Ilyas looked into their eyes and understood he was no longer a child to them. He was the end of the world wearing a child’s face.  
He stepped backward into the last ray of twilight and vanished.

**Age 9–14 — Crucible of Legend**  
He became myth made flesh.  
- Freed a slave caravan of scale-folk → branded a trafficker who “stole merchandise for his private army.”  
- Redirected a lava flow from a mining town → accused of summoning the eruption to extort tribute.  
- Sheltered plague refugees → rumors spread he was spreading a new, magical plague.  
Every neutral or kind act was refracted through the prophecy lens and returned darker.  
The Timeline itself seemed to conspire, twisting perception.  
He learned fast: fighting the role would Fracture reality worse. So he began to **play it perfectly** — cold, arrogant, ancient, untouchable. The more convincingly villainous he acted, the more the world stabilized around the fear he generated.  
By fourteen the halo had settled into ominous violet-black during full manifestation. He had mastered hiding it completely in daily life.

**Age 14–15 — Solitude & Restoration**  
Discovered an abandoned mountaintop mansion — half-ruined, sun-bleached, forgotten.  
Restored it using light-constructs and anonymous quest earnings (always under heavy illusion).  
Here, for the first time in centuries, he could simply **exist** without performance.  
He spent months in near-total silence, refining control, learning to keep the left eye’s computational storm dormant, letting the soul-deep exhaustion settle like sediment.

**Age 15 — The Unscripted Choice (Meeting Umi)**  
While foraging in a frost-bound forest, he passed a massive, magical flower bud preserved in perpetual winter.  
His passive light — the gentle pink glow he could never fully suppress — brushed the petals.  
They opened.  
Inside lay a girl of ice and sorrow, curled fetal, hibernating in cryo-stasis.  
No prophecy spoke of her. No legend predicted this moment.  
For the first time in over a millennium, the Timeline offered no script.  
Ilyas reached in and chose — not as Commando, not as Fixed Point, but as a lonely boy who recognized another outcast.  
He carried her home through biting cold, enduring frostbite that would scar his forearms forever, because for once the choice was his alone.
