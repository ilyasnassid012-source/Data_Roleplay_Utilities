## Detailed Scene Documentation

### Scene 1 — Restoration/Confrontation — "The Alley Revival and Slaver Chaos"

#### Scene Metadata
- **Scene Type:** Restoration / Confrontation
- **Primary Participants:** 
  - Ilyas Roshîn — Initiator / Protector / Restorer
  - Rokudo Naruka — Recipient / Revived
  - Drunk Slaver #1 & #2 — Initial aggressors
  - Slaver Leader + 4 Armored Guards — Secondary threat
- **Location:** Rain-soaked back alley alcove behind Gilded Cage Plaza (wet cobblestones, broken crates, flickering lantern)
- **Time Context:** Night, Veil Festival Week – Day 4, ≈01:15 to 01:51
- **Duration:** ~36 minutes
- **POV(s):** Rokudo internal monologue dominant + Ilyas actions
- **Tone/Atmosphere:** Grim sleaze turning to surreal power display then chaos

#### Pre-Scene Context
Rokudo exists only as a severed head lying in the rain. Two drunk slavers find her, lift her by the hair, and prepare to use her as "free head." Ilyas arrives in spirit form (upside-down violet ghost, singing nonsense), scares them off with halo color change, takes possession of the head gently (cradling from below, no hair-pulling). He moves her to shelter and begins 7-minute full-body transfiguration using Body & Soul Information Change. The slaver returns with 4 guards, having witnessed the entire revival.

**Character States Entering:**
- **Ilyas Roshîn:** Spirit form, casual but protective, groceries in hand, ready to restore
- **Rokudo Naruka:** Head-only, emotionless externally, internally wise/childish with deep craving for body
- **Drunk Slaver #1 & #2:** Drunk, opportunistic, cruel, already lifting the head
- **Slaver Leader + Guards:** Greedy, armed with collars, motivated by witnessed power

#### Full Scene Narration
The rain hammered the alley. Two drunk slavers lifted Rokudo’s head by the hair, laughing, one already loosening his belt. Ilyas floated in (upside-down violet ghost), singing nonsense, halo shifting color to standard spirit white-yellow. The slavers panicked and fled. Ilyas cradled the head gently from below, moved to shelter, and spent 7 minutes rewriting soul/body information. Rokudo’s full original non-human body formed: fair skin, long black hair, big breasts, thick thighs, sensitive nipples. Consciousness returned. She spoke first raspy “hello…?”, produced shaky laughter, tears, first voluntary blink and finger twitch. Ilyas complimented her in present tense, wrapped her in the slaver’s discarded coat for coverage. The same slaver returned with 4 guards, demanding both. Ilyas stood protectively, gender-swapped the guards instantly (temporary but they believed permanent). Three guards screamed, clutching new bodies; one (original female) quietly enjoyed the upgrade. The slaver broke and fled screaming. Ilyas made the upgraded guard’s changes permanent with consent. The alley fell silent. Rokudo processed her new body, whispering gratitude.

Rokudo & Misa alone — shared worst experiences (Misa’s petrification/objectification, Rokudo’s head-only abuse), bonding through mutual trauma with dark gallows humor and quiet understanding. Ilyas returned with plates, stood silently watching (tearful), admitted “I’m not crying… cutting onions”, placed food. Misa gently called out his heavier past.

- **Scene 2** → **Scene 3** — Dinner & bonding lead to shower
- **Scene 3** → **Scene 4** — Demonstration leads to cuddles & bedtime

### Thematic Links
- **Theme/Motif:** Restoration & belonging — from head-only object to full person with family

### Character Arcs Within Scenes

## Notes & Observations

### Narrative Techniques Used
- Gradual sensory awakening for Rokudo
- Trauma bonding through shared stories before meal
- Demonstration as teaching tool for new body

### Unusual Elements
- Casual modular body use (head detachment for oral) treated as normal and empowering
- Misa’s complete lack of jealousy while sharing Ilyas

### Archival Challenges
- Balancing explicit demonstration with emotional tenderness
- Tracking modular body mechanics accurately

### Future Reference Points
- Establishes Rokudo’s modular body as core ability
- Solidifies small family unit of three
- Sets safe home base for Act 1 continuation
