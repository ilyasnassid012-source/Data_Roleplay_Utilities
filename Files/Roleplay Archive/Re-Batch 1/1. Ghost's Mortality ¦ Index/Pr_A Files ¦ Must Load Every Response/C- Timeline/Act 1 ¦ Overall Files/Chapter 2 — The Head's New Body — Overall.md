## Timeline
### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
The story opens in a rainy back alley during the Veil Festival. Rokudo Naruka exists only as a severed head, enduring casual abuse from two drunk slavers who see her as "free head." Ilyas Roshîn, a powerful spirit, enters in ghost form, intervenes, restores her full original non-human body, and takes her to his mansion where Misa the Petrifier awaits. The chapter explores restoration, trauma bonding, intimacy, modular body abilities, and the beginning of a small, makeshift family unit. Unresolved threads from prior events (Misa’s long grief, ongoing slavery system) are touched upon but the focus is on Rokudo’s revival and first night of safety.

#### Scene 1 — The Alley Encounter & Body Restoration
**Character's Povs:** Rokudo's internal monologue dominant, Ilyas POV  
**Characters Present/Knows:** Rokudo Naruka (present, head only), Drunk Slaver #1 (present), Drunk Slaver #2 (present), Ilyas Roshîn (arrives in spirit form)  
**Approximate Time Range:** 01:15 to 01:51  
**Scene Type:** Confrontation / Restoration / EmotionalReunion  

**Narrative:**
The scene opens with Rokudo’s severed head lying in the rain-soaked alley. Two drunk slavers approach, lift her by the hair, prepare to use her. Ilyas arrives in spirit form (upside-down violet ghost, singing nonsense), scares the slavers with halo color change, takes possession of the head gently (cradling from below, no hair-pulling), dismisses the slavers with casual power display. He moves her to shelter, restores her full original non-human body (fair skin, long black hair, big breasts, thick thighs, sensitive nipples, etc.) over 7 minutes of focused soul/body information rewriting. Rokudo experiences first sensations, speaks her first raspy “hello…?”, shaky laughter, tears, first voluntary blink & finger twitch. Ilyas compliments her beauty in present tense, wraps her in the slaver’s discarded coat for coverage & warmth. Sudden return of the same slaver with 4 guards (collars ready). Ilyas stands protectively, gender-swaps the guards (temporary but they believe permanent), causing chaos. Three guards panic/scream; one (original female) quietly enjoys the upgrade. Slaver breaks and flees screaming. Ilyas makes the upgraded guard’s changes permanent with consent. Scene ends with Rokudo processing her new body, whispering gratitude, and being carried toward the mansion.

**Approximate Time Range:** 02:05 to 02:23  
**Scene Type:** EmotionalReunion / Domestic / TraumaBonding  

**Narrative:**
Ilyas carries unsteady Rokudo bridal-style into the mansion entrance hall. Misa (already awake/waiting) sees them, steps forward calmly but surprised. Ilyas places Rokudo on couch, tells Misa she’s staying, announces making dinner, and heads to kitchen. Rokudo & Misa alone for first time — share worst experiences (Misa’s petrification/objectification, Rokudo’s head-only abuse), bond through mutual trauma with dark gallows humor and quiet understanding. Ilyas returns with plates, stands silently watching (tearful in ghost form), admits “I’m not crying… cutting onions”, places food. Misa gently calls out his heavier past. Group eats first real meal in long time — Rokudo overwhelmed by flavors (raspy gasps/tears/shaky laughter), Misa calm & approving. Ilyas smiles/proud, suggests shower together later.

**Approximate Time Range:** 02:30 to 02:50  
**Scene Type:** NSFW / Intimate / Demonstration  

**Narrative:**
Warm shower running. Ilyas (in underwear) gently cleans both girls, focusing on Rokudo (chest/neck/shoulders), smiling/soft while cupping & washing her breasts. Rokudo overwhelmed, leans into touch, raspy emotional responses. Misa reminisces about yesterday’s shower, then teases about “the corner thing” to “test” Rokudo’s new body. Rokudo consents shyly. Ilyas frees his cock, presses against Misa’s ass. Penetration begins — slow → harder/deeper thrusts. Misa moans/encourages Rokudo to watch. Climax — Ilyas releases thick load deep inside Misa. Misa pulls off, stays on knees, commands Rokudo to clean leftover with mouth. Rokudo consents, begins sucking → her head detaches cleanly (new ability: no pain, full control, swallowed contents auto-transport to body). Detached head deep-throats fully. Second climax — thick release swallowed, transported. Ilyas pulls head out, reattaches by pressing down (seam seals instantly). Rokudo rasps dazed wonder. Misa praises and teases future play, realizing full modular potential (detachable hips/pussy as fuck-toy). Rokudo reacts with shock turning to aroused curiosity. Ilyas sits on marble floor catching breath, admits “perverted genius” label with resigned chuckle. Misa teases affectionately. Rokudo shyly accepts and suggests cuddles.

**Scene Type:** Domestic / Emotional / Bedtime  

**Narrative:**
Scene shifts to Rokudo’s new bedroom. Rokudo in simple nightgown, tucked tightly under covers by Ilyas. He grins/softly says “Cuddling TIME…” while joking about detachable arms. Rokudo rasps sleepy responses, begs him to stay tonight and asks Misa if okay just for today. Misa responds warmly/playfully from doorway, encouraging Rokudo’s plea with no jealousy. Ilyas moves fully into bed beside Rokudo, lays down, one hand over her hip holding her tight. Misa slides in on opposite side, drapes arm & snakes over both. Rokudo melts completely against Ilyas, rasps sleepy “goodnight… my perverted genius…” & “goodnight… my family…”, drifts into peaceful sleep — first in years. Misa murmurs goodnight, snakes coil lazily. Three bodies settle into quiet breathing sync. Room fades to darkness.
