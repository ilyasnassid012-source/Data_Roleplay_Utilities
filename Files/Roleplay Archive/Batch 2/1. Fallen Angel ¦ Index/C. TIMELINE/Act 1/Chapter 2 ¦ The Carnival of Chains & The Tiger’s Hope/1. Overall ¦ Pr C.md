## Timeline

### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
Chapter 2 opens immediately after Chapter 1’s intimate claiming. Ilyas & Yuno in domestic peace at the riverside mansion (breakfast teasing, Yuno clinging/cock-warming while he sleeps). Unresolved from Chapter 1: Yuno’s full harem intent declared, Ilyas’s coma-sleep trait established, distant slaver consequences looming. Status quo: safe haven, possessive bond cemented, first harem member secured.

#### Scene 1 — Breakfast Domestic Bliss
- **Character's Povs:** Yuno (primary), Ilyas (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Yuno
- **Approximate Time Range:** Morning after Chapter 1
- **Scene Type:** Intimate/Domestic

**Narrative:**
Dawn light filters through balcony curtains. Yuno wakes first — still joined with Ilyas, rocking hips lazily, reading his research-heavy dream thoughts (boring but endearing). She grinds slow, possessive, affirming harem beginning. Ilyas stirs unconsciously, body responding (thickening inside her). Morning ride escalates — Yuno mounts reverse cowgirl, rides him to mutual climax while he remains asleep. She pulls off, lets combined loads spill, flips ass-up, lazily strokes his soft cock until drifting to nap. Ilyas wakes groggy, notes sticky aftermath, teases Yuno about dream/noises, pats her ass playfully while heading to clean/breakfast. Yuno clings, confirms night + morning use, suggests joint shower. Domestic teasing continues into kitchen — Yuno perches on counter, legs spread, offering distraction while he cooks.

#### Scene 2 — Yuno’s Distant Plea
- **Character's Povs:** Yuno (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Yuno (Ilyas asleep)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Morning → midday
- **Scene Type:** Internal/Despair Detection

**Narrative:**
Yuno skips playfully through neighborhood streets (wearing Ilyas’s oversized black t-shirt + open robe). Suddenly freezes mid-skip — thought-reading curse catches distant, broken thoughts from Kokōshibo at the Carnival of Chains. She drops to knees, pleads desperately to Narrator (“lead him there any way possible”). Halo flares, wings snap open in urgency.

#### Scene 3 — Curse Bird Drop
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas
- **Approximate Time Range:** Mid-morning
- **Scene Type:** Action/Transport

**Narrative:**
Ilyas walks casually with groceries, muttering about forgetting wasabi (“I dont Even Make sushi... Nevertheless I Still Need stuff to Get....”). Suddenly snatched by massive eagle-legged curse bird — lifted high despite panic (“FuckFuckFuckFuck... Too high, i Hate this. FUCK YOU FATE”). Dropped directly above Carnival of Chains arena.

#### Scene 4 — Arena Domination & Liberation
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, guards, slaver handler, Kokōshibo, crowd
- **Approximate Time Range:** Midday
- **Scene Type:** Combat/Rescue

**Narrative:**
Ilyas free-falls head-first, bites hand to activate blood manipulation, manifests scythe to pierce pillar, slows descent, explodes scythe for controlled crouch landing. Guards charge (spear thrust, chain lash, net launcher). Ilyas fires blood lasers at all weapons simultaneously — destroys them, slices guards' hands/arms, mixes blood for control. Fires additional blood spears to seal all doors. Commands guards to restrain slaver handler and open cages. Blood threads force compliance — guards pin slaver handler, elites pinned in seats by spears/serpent. Slaver handler publicly degraded Kokōshibo (“shouldn’t exist, flat, worthless”). Ilyas breaks her chain with laser. Kokōshibo watches in stunned silence, fragile hope flickering. Freed slaves flee in awe. Yuno bursts in mid-yell (“GET YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF THEM—!!”), stops upon seeing Ilyas handled everything, delighted (“you already took care of everything, didn’t you…?”).

#### Scene 5 — Return & Shower Intimacy
- **Character's Povs:** Trio
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Yuno, Kokōshibo
- **Approximate Time Range:** Afternoon to evening
- **Scene Type:** Intimate/Healing

**Narrative:**
Group returns to mansion. Shower scene begins — Ilyas gently cleans both Yuno and Kokōshibo. Kokōshibo cries softly from relief (no one mocked her flat chest/small assets, unlike past). Emotional flood releases — she clings desperately to Ilyas’s hand/wrist. Yuno soothes possessively (“you’re perfect just like this… our little kitten”). Kokōshibo’s yandere side emerges — fixation on Ilyas (“want him… only him… don’t let go…”). She falls asleep mid-cleaning from exhaustion.

#### Scene 6 — Bedtime Aftercare
- **Character's Povs:** Trio
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Yuno, Kokōshibo
- **Approximate Time Range:** Evening
- **Scene Type:** Aftercare/Rest

**Narrative:**
Ilyas carries sleeping Kokōshibo to guest bedroom, covers her with towels/blankets, tucks her in. She clings desperately even in sleep. Yuno watches with possessive delight (“so precious… our little kitten finally feels safe…”). Trio settles into new family dynamic.

### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**
The depraved Carnival of Chains lies disrupted — slavers pinned, slaves freed, spectacle shattered. Kokōshibo rescued, collared but free, tentatively joined the group, asleep in Ilyas’s arms at the riverside mansion. Yuno’s harem vision expands (“both mine now”). Ilyas calm leader, full control established. The stage is set for harem growth, collar removal, and distant consequences.

##### Overall Consequences
- Carnival of Chains disrupted — slavers restrained, slaves freed
- Kokōshibo rescued & joined harem tentatively
- Harem expanded to two members (Yuno fully devoted, Kokōshibo shyly attached)
- Mansion now home to three — domestic peace restored with new member

##### Unresolved Threads
- Kokōshibo’s suppression collar (still active)
- Potential revenge from surviving slavers/auction elites
- Yuno’s thought-reading curse evolution
- Future harem recruitment (Yuno’s intent declared)
- Ilyas’s blood manipulation limits & fatigue

##### Relationships Update
- **Ilyas & Yuno:** Stronger possessive bond — Yuno fully devoted first wife
- **Ilyas & Kokōshibo:** New trust & attachment — Kokōshibo’s yandere seed emerging (clings desperately, prefers Ilyas accompany her)
- **Yuno & Kokōshibo:** Protective sisterly/possessive warmth — Yuno sees her as “little treasure” to nurture
- **Group Dynamic:** Emerging family — protective, intimate, healing

## Reminders
### Pending Confrontations
- Surviving slavers/auction elites vs Ilyas (potential revenge)
- Kokōshibo’s collar removal (future priority)

### Missions / Choices Made
- Rescue choice → full liberation granted non-lethally
- Invitation to Kokōshibo → accepted tentatively
