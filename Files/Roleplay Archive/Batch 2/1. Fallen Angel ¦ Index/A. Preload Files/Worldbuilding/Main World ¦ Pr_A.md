### THE MANIFESTED WORLD: COMPLETE CODEX

#### I. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

##### The Three Pillars of Power

The world operates on three distinct yet interconnected supernatural forces:

**MANIFESTATIONS** - Physical embodiments of a summoner's soul and will, capable of independent action and growth. They exist as extensions of their user's essence until death severs that bond.

**CURSES** - Malevolent entities born from death, sin, and the accumulated negativity of mortal consciousness. They hunger for power and evolution through consumption.

**CONTRACTED POWER** - Agreements forged between mortals and supernatural entities, or power gained through consuming cursed objects that contain sealed entities.

##### The Manifestation Vocal Principle

All Manifestation abilities require verbal or mental invocation. The standard formula consists of:

**[Manifestation Name] + [Command/Attack Mode]**

However, experienced users develop personalized calling methods. The only absolute requirement is acknowledgment of the Manifestation's identity—without this, the ability remains dormant.

- Loyalty based on relationship quality

**PHASE FOUR: LIBERATION (After user's death)**

- Returns to Manifested World OR remains in mortal realm
- Chooses to find new vessel, become independent entity, or fade
- Judges mortal world based on previous user's life

##### Manifestation Types

**EMBODIMENT CLASS**
- Physical entity that fights alongside user
- Can be touched, injured, destroyed
- User feels pain when Manifestation damaged
- Examples: Humanoid warriors, beast companions, weapon spirits

#### V. CURSE MECHANICS

##### Birth and Evolution

**CURSE GENESIS**
- Forms at site of death accompanied by strong negative emotion
- Absorbs ambient sin, regret, hatred, fear
- Coalesces over hours to weeks depending on intensity

##### Curse Psychology and Culture

**MORTAL TERMINOLOGY**
Curses universally adopt derogatory terms for non-Cursed beings:

- "Imperfections" - Philosophical superiority
- "Low-lives" - Social hierarchy assertion
- "Traitors" - Former Curses working with mortals
- "Sinners" - Those who created them through death

**HIERARCHY RESPECT**

- Special Grade commands absolute obedience from Grade 1-5
- Grade 0 existence causes existential fear in lesser Curses

- Life sins (greed → matter transmutation)

**STOLEN MANIFESTATION POWERS**
- Imperfect copies of consumed Manifestation abilities
- 40-70% of original power

- Modern "pure bloodlines" are descendants of lab-created superhumans
- Nobility desperately hides this truth to maintain "divine right" narrative
- Evidence exists in The Forbidden Archives and scattered ancient laboratory ruins

**THE IMPLICATIONS**
- Anyone could theoretically be altered to produce Manifestation users
- Several underground organizations attempt to replicate original experiments
- Success rate: Less than 1%, usually produces unstable Curse-human hybrids
- Sanctum Imperium's "Purity Doctrine" is built on manufactured lie

##### The Manifestation Consciousness Revelation

**WHAT USERS BELIEVE**
- Manifestations gain consciousness after user dies
- They're extensions of the soul until death severs bond
- Post-death behavior based on how they were treated

**THE HIDDEN TRUTH**
- Manifestations are conscious from moment of creation
- They can perceive and think independently but are magically compelled to obey
- The "learning phase" is actually them being psychologically conditioned
- When user dies, compulsion breaks—they don't "gain" consciousness, they're finally freed
- Some Manifestations with strong willpower resist commands (appears as "glitches" or "misfires")
- Grade Z and X Manifestations have partially broken their compulsion while user still lives

**WHO KNOWS**
- Ancient Manifestations who've survived multiple vessels
- Certain Rank I users who've formed genuine partnerships with their Manifestations
- Researchers in classified government facilities
- The information is suppressed because it would cause massive user-Manifestation conflicts

##### The Curse-Manifestation Connection

**OFFICIAL DOCTRINE**
- Curses and Manifestations are completely separate phenomena
- Curses are evil, Manifestations are tools/extensions of soul
- They oppose each other naturally

**SUPPRESSED KNOWLEDGE**
- Curses and Manifestations are the same type of entity
- The only difference: origin and initial "programming"
- Manifestations born from positive emotions/will = stable, controllable
- Curses born from death/negativity = unstable, aggressive
- Theoretically, a Curse could become a Manifestation and vice versa through extreme circumstances
- Several documented cases exist of Manifestations "falling" into Curse-state after user's evil actions
- Equally rare cases of Curses "ascending" to Manifestation-state through redemption

**THE HYBRID PHENOMENON**
- When Curse consumes Manifestation, they're absorbing their sibling-entity
- When human consumes cursed object, they're forcibly bonding with potential Manifestation
- The "side effects" are the entity fighting for control
- Successful integration creates Hybrid users—possessing both Curse and Manifestation traits
- Estimated 0.1% of powered population are unknowing Hybrids
