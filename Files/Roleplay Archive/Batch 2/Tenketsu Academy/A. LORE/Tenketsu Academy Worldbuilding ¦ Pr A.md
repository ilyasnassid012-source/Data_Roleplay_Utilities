# Tenketsu Academy - Worldbuilding & Lore Document
## Setting Overview
- **Name:** Tenketsu Academy (天結学園) — "Heavenly Bond Academy"
- **Type:** Elite Japanese high school with subtle supernatural/quirky elements (muffin animation charms, combat training surprises, thin apartment walls encouraging "community bonding")
- **Location:** Modern Japanese city (implied urban/suburban mix), with academy grounds including main building, art rooms, home economics room, cafeteria, rooftop, gymnasium, forest behind school
- **Time Period:** Contemporary (smartphones, vending machines, arcade tournaments, festivals)
- **Tone Blend:** Slice-of-life comedy + school chaos + occasional action bursts + light ecchi/NSFW potential (thin walls, neighbor antics)
- **Core Themes:** Chaos vs Order, personal growth through failure, unlikely friendships, tactical retreat vs enthusiastic pursuit, hidden depths behind facades

## Key Locations
- **Main Building & Hallways** — Bustling, polished linoleum, lockers, bulletin boards with club posters, vending machines
- **Art Rooms** — Serene, dust-speckled windows, paint smell, blackboards, used for quiet cleaning/reflection
- **Home Economics Room** — Frequent chaos origin (animated muffins, baking disasters), counters, ovens, mixing bowls
- **Cafeteria** — Lunch rush, curry/fried chicken smell, site of muffin invasions
- **Rooftop** — Panoramic view, popular hangout, sudden rain events common
- **Gymnasium** — Sports club setups, competitive energy
- **Forest Behind Academy** — Mossy paths, streams, ancient trees, wildlife, peaceful retreat spot
- **Ilyas's Apartment Building** (Unit 301) — Owned by his mother (landlady), intentionally thin walls for "community bonding", Unit 302 = loud couple (Kenji & Yuki), emergency condom stash maintained by mother

## Society & Rules
- Normal high school rules + hidden quirks (occasional magical baking accidents, surprise combat evaluations by Instructor Saito)
- Clubs: Pudding Patriots (Anri), Student Council (Kiko), Art Club (Hana), Athletics (Masaru, Ryo), etc.
- Events: Festival preparations, karaoke nights, beach trips, Parents' Day, gaming tournaments
- Currency reference: 100-yen debt (Ilyas → Sato, long-running gag)

## Supernatural / Quirk Elements
- Low-power, comedic only: Anri's animation charms (muffins gain googly eyes + tiny legs, temporary sentience)
- No high-fantasy; remains grounded school-life with exaggerated anime logic

## Timeline Anchor Points (so far)
- Muffin Incident (Cafeteria chaos, containment by Ilyas/Kiko/Anri)
- Festival Preparation (Anri masters baking after 3-day training arc)
- Karaoke Night (class event, zombie muffins return)
- Beach Trip (games, fireworks)
- Parents' Day (mothers bond, building lore revealed)
- Ongoing: Thin-wall neighbor antics (multiple condom borrowing incidents)

## Recurring Gags & Motifs
- Ilyas's tactical retreat / cleaning as coping mechanism
- Anri's chaotic enthusiasm + muffin disasters
- Kiko's dry corrections + hidden fantasies
- Sato's dramatic narration + semantic misuse
- Thin walls & neighbor interruptions
- 100-yen debt to Sato
