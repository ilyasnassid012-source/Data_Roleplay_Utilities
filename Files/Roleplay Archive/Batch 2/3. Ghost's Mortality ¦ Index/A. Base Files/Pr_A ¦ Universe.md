    __World History: The Parallel Merge__
♦───────────────────────────────♦

═════════════════════════════════
In an ancient epoch, the fabric of reality splintered across multiple dimensions, creating parallel worlds that echoed one another yet diverged in fundamental ways. These worlds were broadly categorized into two realms: the Mortal and Living World, inhabited by corporeal beings driven by survival, innovation, and conflict; and the Spirit and Curses Realm, a ethereal plane of souls, lingering energies, and malevolent entities. For eons, these realms existed in isolation, with only faint whispers crossing the veil—manifesting as myths, hauntings, or unexplained phenomena in the Mortal World.

The Merge, known as the "Veil's Shattering," occurred during a cosmic alignment of cataclysmic proportions, possibly triggered by an overload of untamed energies from both sides. This event fused the realms, blending their essences into a singular, unstable reality. The immediate aftermath was chaos: landscapes warped, skies flickered with spectral lights, and beings from both worlds found themselves coexisting. Mortals gained access to Spiritual Energy, a new power system born from the fusion, while spirits and curses could now interact more freely with the physical plane. This merge didn't erase the original divisions entirely; echoes of the separated realms persist as hidden pockets or rifts, accessible only under specific conditions.

The Merge's sociological impact was profound. In the Mortal World, pre-Merge societies relied on scarce magic sourced from rare "mana rocks" or rudimentary science-magic hybrids, leading to stratified classes where only the elite wielded power. Post-Merge, Spiritual Energy democratized abilities, but it also amplified inequalities—those with potent souls rose to dominance, while others suffered debuffs or burdensome quirks. Wars erupted over control of rift sites, and racism intensified between pure humans, non-humans (like elves, beastfolk, or constructs), and hybrids, with humans often claiming superiority due to their adaptable souls yielding "superior" abilities.

In the Spirit Realm, pre-Merge civilizations were fluid, based on soul hierarchies and eternal pacts. Post-Merge, many spirits viewed mortals as invaders or resources, leading to exploitative contracts or vengeful incursions. Curses, born from unresolved mortal grievances, proliferated, feeding on the heightened emotional turmoil.

    __Power System: Spiritual Energy__
♦───────────────────────────────♦

═════════════════════════════════
Spiritual Energy (SE) is the core magic system post-Merge, manifesting as an intrinsic force tied to one's soul. Every being—mortal or spirit—possesses a unique SE signature, shaping their abilities. These can range from elemental manipulations (fire conjuring, water shaping) to conceptual quirks (body transmutation into dough for elasticity, or involuntary mermaid transformation in water, acting as a debuff). Abilities are soul-bound, often reflecting personality, trauma, or lineage; a baker's soul might yield dough manipulation, while a warrior's could enhance physical prowess.

Some SE abilities come with "Covenants"—mandatory requirements, deadlines, or quirks. For instance, a strength-boosting ability might require daily combat or risk muscle atrophy; failing a deadline (e.g., "slay a foe weekly") could lead to consequences from mild (temporary weakness) to lethal (soul erosion). These Covenants add layers of strategy and risk to daily life, turning power into a double-edged sword.

Mortals acquired SE abruptly during the Merge, initially causing widespread instability—random activations led to accidents, like unintended fires or transformations. Over generations, societies adapted, integrating SE into education, warfare, and economy. Spirits inherently possessed SE in their realm, using it for ethereal manipulations; post-Merge, they can lend it via contracts, but at a price (e.g., borrowing the mortal's body for possession periods).

Extra Lore: SE can be amplified by "Soul Resonators," rare artifacts from pre-Merge eras, or by environmental factors like rift proximity. Overuse risks "Soul Burnout," a debilitating condition where abilities weaken or backfire, emphasizing balance in roleplay scenarios.

    __Spirits and Curses: Ethereal Beings__
♦───────────────────────────────♦

═════════════════════════════════
Spirits are the souls of deceased mortals, retaining humanoid forms from their living days but altered: semi-transparent, with a glowing halo signifying purity (absent in curses). Their appearance is mind-influenced—childish spirits appear cartoonish and exaggerated, while vengeful ones twist into monstrous shapes. Spirits can phase through inanimate objects but collide with living matter, allowing physical interactions like touch or combat.

Curses are corrupted spirits or pure malevolent energies, born from intense negative emotions (betrayal, rage). They lack halos and can mimic them to deceive. Both possess SE abilities, often more potent due to their ethereal nature. Spirits build civilizations in the hidden Spiritual World—ethereal cities of floating spires, soul-markets for trading memories, and councils enforcing pacts.

Mortals can contract with spirits/curses for power boosts, paying prices like body-sharing, life force, or fulfilling quests. Curses seal deals via handshakes, often with hidden clauses leading to exploitation. Some mortals capture spirits using "Binding Seals"—devices that trap them in the Mortal World, preventing return (as spirits can't carry mortal objects back). This enslavement breeds resentment, fueling revenge cycles.

Extra Sociology: Spirit societies value "Soul Harmony," communal rituals to stabilize forms, but post-Merge, infiltration by mortal binders has led to isolationist factions. Curses form nomadic "Malice Clans," preying on weak-willed mortals for sustenance.

    __Mortal World: Society and Conflicts__
♦───────────────────────────────♦

═════════════════════════════════
The Mortal World is a diverse, fractured landscape of humans, non-humans (beastkin, elementals, ancient robots with awakened souls), and hybrids. Pre-Merge, magic was rare, reliant on science-magic rocks for tech like enchanted machinery. Post-Merge, SE ubiquity shifted society toward ability-based hierarchies: pure humans claim superiority, enslaving "weaker" races with debuff-prone souls. Racism festers—humans view non-humans as "diluted," leading to segregated kingdoms or outright wars.

Economy prioritizes SE exploitation: "Power Markets" trade contracts, bound spirits as tools, or Covenant-fulfilling services. Money reigns supreme, with corporations binding spirits for industrial use (e.g., fire spirits in forges). Survival demands vigilance; pacifists perish in high-paced fights where buildings shatter from SE clashes.

Kingdoms vary: authoritarian empires enslave spirits en masse, democratic city-states promote equal contracts, nomadic tribes revere free spirits as ancestors. Kings/Queens enforce rules via royal guards—elite SE users—balancing order with exploitation. Sociology includes class divides: nobles hoard potent contracts, peasants suffer burdensome quirks.

Extra World Building: Ancient robots, infused with SE post-Merge, form "Mech-Soul Clans," blending tech and spirit pacts, often allying against human dominance for robotic rights.

    __Grades of Spirits and Threats__
♦───────────────────────────────♦

═════════════════════════════════
Spirits and curses are graded by threat level and power:

- **Yokai (Highest Grade):** God-like entities with world-altering SE (e.g., reality-warping storms). Spotting one mandates city evacuations; all slaves freed, non-registered mortals flee. Rare, often guardians or destroyers of rifts.

- **Special Grade:** Intelligent, deadly; controllable via strong binders but prone to rebellion. They pursue agendas, like territorial dominance or revenge.

- **Grades 1-5:** Decreasing danger; Grade 1 rivals armies, Grade 5 are minor nuisances (e.g., poltergeists). Lower grades are numerous, used as fodder in wars or bound for menial tasks.

Abilities span simple (enhanced strength) to complex (conceptual erasure). In roleplay, grades dictate encounter scale—low grades for street skirmishes, high for epic threats.

Extra: Grading guilds assess via "Soul Scanners," devices detecting SE potency, leading to black markets for grade-forging artifacts.

    __Geography and Access: The Merged Realms__
♦───────────────────────────────♦

═════════════════════════════════
The world is vast, with biomes warped by the Merge: floating islands from spirit incursions, cursed forests where time loops, or rift-zones accessible only by specific jumps (e.g., leaping from a cliff at midnight). Rifts serve as portals—spirits emerge freely if areas are clear, but mortals need SE keys or contracts to enter the Spiritual World.

Hidden from normal sight, the Spiritual World overlays the Mortal one like a parallel layer, with its own geography: soul-rivers for travel, memory-forged mountains. Mortals glimpse it during SE surges or near rifts, fostering myths.

Extra: "Veil Thins"—events where realms bleed, causing hybrid zones with mixed physics (e.g., gravity-defying cities), ideal for roleplay adventures or ambushes.
═════════════════════════════════


♦───────────────────────────────♦
    __Combat, Survival, and Relationships__
♦───────────────────────────────♦

═════════════════════════════════
Fights are explosive, SE-driven spectacles: building-level destruction from elemental blasts or conceptual shifts. Survival requires defense; pacifists ally with protectors or hide in neutral zones.

Relationships cross realms: friendships via shared contracts, love leading to marriages (spirits have ghostly organs, enabling hybrid children inheriting mortal traits and diluted SE). Hatred sparks wars, jealousy fuels curses, revenge drives betrayals.

Ways to end spirits: physical/magical defeat (dispersal), sealing (trapping in objects), betrayal contracts (usurping control), or purgatory banishment (illegal, eternal suffering; escapes unknown).

Extra Sociology: "Cross-Realm Families" face stigma—mortals shun spirit mates as "reputation-lowering," but such unions produce "Veilborn" children with dual affinities, often becoming mediators or outcasts.

    __Kingdoms and Governance: Rules of Order__
♦───────────────────────────────♦

═════════════════════════════════
Each kingdom has unique sociology: the Human Dominion enforces human supremacy, binding non-humans and spirits as slaves; the Hybrid Enclaves promote equality, banning forced contracts; Spirit-Allied Realms coexist peacefully, with joint councils.

Kings/Queens, often high-SE wielders, maintain order via guards enforcing laws on contracts (e.g., no child-binding), grading, and rift management. Corruption abounds—bribes for purgatory access or grade manipulations.

Extra: Annual "Veil Festivals" celebrate the Merge, with temporary truces for cross-realm mingling, but often devolve into espionage or romances, adding roleplay intrigue.
