## Timeline
### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
The story opens post-Parallel Merge in a world where spiritual energy (SE) is exploited for slavery. Ilyas Roshîn (user character), a ghost who returned after being killed by slavers, arrives at the Gilded Cage Plaza during the Veil Festival. Misa the Petrifier (his former companion) is secretly present, having mourned him for years. The status quo is a sanctioned slave auction run by the Dominion Guild. Unresolved threads: Misa's grief, Ilyas's unknown return, ongoing slavery system.

#### Scene 1 — The Auction Interruption
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas POV dominant
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Valerian Veilborn (present, conducting auction), Fire-aspected beastkin youth (Lot 1, present), Dominion Seers (present), Auction Guards (present), Misa (hidden observer)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late Afternoon, Veil Festival Week – Day 3
- **Scene Type:** ComedyRelief / Action (non-violent)

**Narrative:**
Ilyas casually interrupts the auction by waving a pizza slice and asking absurd questions about the "merchandise." Valerian attempts to maintain control but calls in Seers when Ilyas questions security against powerful spirits. Seers scan Ilyas and find nothing due to his Body & Soul Information Change. Ilyas then manifests his pink-violet halo, revealing himself as a spirit. All bindings collapse. Valerian psychologically breaks and surrenders the captives. Misa reveals herself and tests Ilyas with full petrification gaze (old ritual). Ilyas survives theatrically, confirming his identity. Reunion begins with hugs, tears, and immediate nostalgic teasing.

#### Scene 2 — Reunion & Walk Home
- **Character's Povs:** Dual Ilyas & Misa POV
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Misa (primary), Valerian (background, defeated)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late Afternoon to Early Evening
- **Scene Type:** EmotionalReunion / Dialogue-Heavy

**Narrative:**
Ilyas and Misa share a tearful hug. Misa admits grief-eating led to her fuller figure. They walk home through the Riverside Woods, exchanging light teasing about old habits (pizza boxes, corner fantasies, snakes). Misa confesses she never left the mansion and kept everything as it was. Sexual tension builds as she admits thinking about "the corner thing" and using snakes as substitutes. They arrive at the mansion.

#### Scene 3 — Kitchen & Breakfast Escalation
- **Character's Povs:** Dual
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Misa
- **Approximate Time Range:** Early Evening
- **Scene Type:** Domestic / Innuendo

**Narrative:**
Ilyas cooks breakfast. Misa watches. Nostalgic "food to get your boobs bigger" line is used. Misa accidentally says something highly inappropriate while thinking innocently about food, then panics and begs to move to the shower. Breakfast is abandoned as they head to the bathroom.

#### Scene 4 — Shower Intimacy (Rounds 1 & 2)
- **Character's Povs:** Dual
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Misa
- **Approximate Time Range:** Early Evening
- **Scene Type:** NSFW / Intimate

**Narrative:**
Both strip. Misa joins under the ceiling rain shower. She removes Ilyas’s underwear. He teases her about her larger breasts. They move to the countertop. Hard, deep sex ensues in reverse cowgirl then standing hold. Multiple creampies, mind-break orgasms, and feral begging ("Fuck your first horny broken bitch") occur. Misa reaches ahegao state.

#### Scene 5 — Bathtub Aftercare & Cuddling
- **Character's Povs:** Dual
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Misa
- **Approximate Time Range:** Mid-Evening
- **Scene Type:** Emotional / Aftercare

**Narrative:**
They move to the deep tub. Ilyas cleans Misa gently while she cries and confesses love, luck, and excitement for a future harem/family of broken girls. Ilyas reassures her, cries with her, and affirms her strength.

#### Scene 6 — Bedroom Tucking In
- **Character's Povs:** Dual
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Misa
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late Evening
- **Scene Type:** Domestic / Rest

**Narrative:**
Both dry off (except hair) and move to Misa’s bedroom. Ilyas tucks her in with nostalgic motions and the "boobs wrapped like a birthday present" line. Misa begs him to sleep beside her. He agrees and lays down. She instantly clings to him like a pillow (legs & arms wrapped tight). They settle into peaceful rest.

#### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**
The chapter ends with Ilyas and Misa safely tucked in bed together after a day of confrontation, reunion, intense intimacy, and emotional healing. The slave auction is dismantled.
