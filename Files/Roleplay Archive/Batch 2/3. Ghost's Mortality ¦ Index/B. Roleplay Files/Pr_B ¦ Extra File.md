## Harem Updates

**Harem Members Sliders — Misa the Petrifier**
- Likeness / Love: 100% (absolute devotion post-reunion)
- Horniness: 98% (post-sex afterglow still high, constantly thinking about “stuffing”)
- Comfortability / Safety: 100% (feels truly safe for the first time in years)

- Emotional Vulnerability: 100% (full breakdown and catharsis allowed)

**Harem Members Updates**
- **Misa The Petrifier**
	- **New Preferences:** Loves being called “your first horny broken bitch,” enjoys being “stuffed full” and seeing belly bulge, craves aftercare cleaning and being tucked in
	- **Personal Changes:** Grief-eating has made her fuller/curvier; now views it positively as “preparation” for Ilyas’s return
	- **Clothes/Style:** Prefers minimal or none when alone with Ilyas; keeps his old cloak and sunglasses as sacred items
	- **Memorable Moments:**
		- “Prove it” petrification test turning into instant hug and tears
		- Accidental dirty talk in kitchen (“stuff me full again”) triggering shower
		- Feral mind-break chant during creampies: “Fuck your first horny broken bitch!”
		- Crying in bathtub while being cleaned, admitting she stopped caring about hygiene without him
		- Clinging like a pillow in bed, whispering “don’t go anywhere”

**Relationships**
- **Misa & Ilyas:** From presumed permanent loss to complete romantic/sexual/emotional partnership. She sees him as home, savior, and future patriarch. He is her safe place to be vulnerable and feral.
- **Misa & Future Harem Members:** Anticipatory big-sister/possessive guardian role — wants to welcome and protect them, but remain “the first and greediest”

**Harem Members's Thoughts (Live Reactions from Chapter)**
- **Misa The Petrifier:**
	- **Misa’s Thoughts During Reunion:** “He’s laughing. He’s actually laughing. After everything… He came back and the first thing he does is joke about boobs while dismantling an empire.”
	- **Misa’s Thoughts During Sex:** “Snakes aren’t the same. They don’t tease back. They don’t look at me like you do.”
	- **Misa’s Thoughts in Bathtub:** “I’m so fucking lucky… Everything’s good now… I can finally rest.”
	- **Misa’s Thoughts in Bed:** “Don’t move. Ever. Just stay like this. Forever.”

**Miscellaneous Extra Data**
- **Mansion Status:** Exactly as Ilyas left it — dust, pizza box collection under sink, his room still a mess (symbolic of unfinished past)
- **Misa’s Grief Coping:** Grief-eating (fuller figure), turning stalkers to stone, keeping Ilyas’s items as shrines
- **Future Hooks:** Harem expansion, Dominion Guild reaction to plaza incident, Ilyas rearranging his room together
- **Emotional Tone Shift:** From years of isolation and self-denial to open vulnerability, feral passion, and peaceful safety
