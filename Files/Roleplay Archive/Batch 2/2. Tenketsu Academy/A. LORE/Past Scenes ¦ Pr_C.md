## Prior Scenes (Pre-Act 1)
### The First Muffin Rebellion – Cafeteria Chaos

The home economics room still smelled of vanilla and burnt sugar when Anri held up the tray like a holy relic. Tiny googly eyes stared back from the muffin tops; stubby frosting arms twitched. One muffin actually wobbled and gave a soft, questioning “mrrph?”

“They’re alive!” Anri squealed, bouncing on her toes. Flour dusted her cheeks like war paint. “They’re ALIVE! Look—this one’s waving! Hi, little muffin warrior!”

She scooped the nearest one into her palm. It promptly sprouted stubby legs and began toddling toward the door with the solemn determination of a soldier marching to destiny. The rest of the tray followed. A small parade of blueberry, chocolate, and cinnamon zombies formed ranks and waddled off the counter, leaving crumb trails like battle banners.

Anri chased after them, arms outstretched. “Wait for mama! We need to show everyone!”

The door swung open under the insistence of the lead muffin’s determined push. The horde spilled into the hallway. Students froze mid-step. Phones rose like lighthouses. Someone screamed in delighted horror.

In the cafeteria, lunch period was in full roar—trays clattering, curry and fried chicken aromas thick in the air—when the first golden-brown invader appeared at the threshold. Then another. Then ten. Then twenty. They wove between legs, climbed chairs, scaled trays. One heroic muffin dove head-first into a pudding cup and began swimming.

Sato Nakamura leapt onto a table, jacket billowing like a cape. “Behold!” he cried, arms flung wide. “The Muffinpocalypse dawns! Henceforth, we stand at the precipice of a new era—where pastries rise against their oppressors!”

A muffin tugged at his shoelace. He shrieked—actually shrieked—and flailed backward, crashing into a chair. The chair tipped. The table wobbled. Trays slid. Curry splattered. Chaos spread like wildfire.

Kiko Nakamura stood near the serving line, clipboard in hand, expression arctic. She stepped neatly over a fallen tray and began dictating into her phone. “Incident report: unauthorized necromantic confectionery outbreak. Source: probable club activity violation. Containment priority: high.”

Anri darted past, container in both hands, giggling maniacally. “Don’t worry, little warriors! Mama’s got you!”

From behind a pillar came Ilyas Kurogane, broom in one hand, sturdy cardboard box in the other. The box was already labeled in neat marker: **Survivors – Do Not Eat**. He moved through the pandemonium with the calm of someone who had long ago accepted that chaos was simply background noise. He bent, scooped a waddling chocolate muffin, deposited it in the box without comment, and continued down the line.

Seven in the box. Twelve remained.

Sato, now sprawled on the floor covered in curry and dignity, raised a trembling fist to the heavens. “I have stared into the abyss… and the abyss offered me baked goods…”

Kiko stepped over him without breaking stride. “Your contribution to containment: negative. Move.”

By the time the last muffin was safely boxed, the cafeteria looked like a war zone and the students were taking selfies with the survivors. Anri beamed at Ilyas. “You’re the best, senpai! You didn’t even flinch!”

Ilyas sealed the box. “Cleanup duty just extended forty minutes.”

Kiko made one final note on her clipboard. “Historical record corrected. Primary containment credit: Kurogane, Nakamura Kiko, Anri. Nakamura Sato: obstacle.”

Sato clutched his chest. “Fratricide upon mine legend!”

### The Sick-Day Gambit – Anri’s Search & Kiko’s Revelation

Ilyas Kurogane had executed the perfect tactical retreat.

At 7:52 a.m. he had presented to Yamada-sensei with a carefully cultivated pallor, a strategically timed cough, and an expression of such genuine exhaustion that even the teacher had hesitated before signing the sick-day slip. Now he lay in his apartment bedroom, blinds drawn, phone on silent, a book open on his chest, basking in the rare silence of a school-free morning.

Meanwhile, back at Tenketsu Academy, Anri was sprinting down the main hallway, red hair flying like a battle flag.

“Ilyas-senpai? …Senpai?!” She popped her head into the art room—empty. Library—empty. She spun on her heel, eyes wide with sudden suspicion. “Did he achieve ultimate tactical evasion?!”

Kiko Nakamura rounded the corner at that exact moment, arms full of council forms, posture impeccable despite the early hour. Anri lit up like she had spotted a lighthouse in fog.

“Kiko! Kiko, you’re so smart and observant! You know everything! Have you seen Ilyas-senpai? It’s critical! The Pudding Patriots’ weekly strategy meeting is at risk! Well, it’s just me and him, and he doesn’t know he’s a Patriot yet, but the principle stands!”

Kiko adjusted her glasses with one slow, deliberate finger. “Your data is outdated. Ilyas Kurogane is not on campus today. Observation: at 7:52 a.m. he presented symptoms of illness to Yamada-sensei. Performance was… atypically convincing. Slight pallor, strategically placed cough. Conclusion: successful negotiation of sick-day exclusion.”

Anri’s shoulders slumped theatrically. “No… the great pudding summit…” Then her eyes narrowed. “Wait. Do you think… he’s faking it? For peace and quiet? That’s so smart! That’s a senpai-level tactic!”

Kiko’s phone buzzed once. She did not need to look to know it was Sato’s reply—probably a single, confident, semantically dubious word. She stepped neatly around the deflated Anri and continued down the hall.

“Your club’s strategic operations will require postponement,” she said without turning. “Redirect enthusiasm. Perhaps toward someone with higher tolerance for spontaneous club formation.”

Behind her, Anri stared at the approaching figure of Sato—still carrying Kiko’s forgotten bag, humming confidently—and her eyes lit with the terrifying glow of a new, brilliant idea.

### The Three-Day Baking Training Arc – From Charcoal to Gold

Day One began with hope and ended in smoke.

Anri stood at the counter in the home economics room, sleeves rolled up, hair tied back with a decorative ribbon, eyes blazing with determination. Fresh ingredients waited in neat rows. Kiko sat on a stool near the window, clipboard balanced on one knee, stopwatch in hand. Ilyas had already been summoned for future taste-testing duty and was wisely staying out of the splash zone.

“Today is the day!” Anri declared, cracking eggs with excessive force. Shell fragments plopped into the batter. “Perfect muffins! Festival-worthy! Everyone will love them!”

Kiko’s pen scratched. “Shell removal advised. Time penalty: fifteen seconds.”

Flour met mixing bowl with enthusiasm. A white cloud erupted. Anri coughed, waved the powder away, and grinned through the mess. “Atmospheric enhancement! Makes the room smell bakery-like!”

Fifteen minutes later the smoke alarm shrieked. Black smoke billowed. Anri yanked open the oven door to reveal charcoal lumps that had once dreamed of being muffins. Her face fell.

“They’re… very well-done…”

Kiko clicked the stopwatch. “Batch one: incinerated. Temperature setting incorrect by fifty degrees. Timer awareness: insufficient. Learning opportunity identified. Reset for attempt two.”

Anri stared at the tray, then rallied. “Round two! I’ll master the oven temperature! Science!”

Ilyas arrived for the afternoon shift. Anri thrust a slightly less incinerated specimen at him. “Quality testing!”

He accepted it with the caution of a bomb-disposal expert, took a bite, chewed for an uncomfortably long time, swallowed with visible effort, and gave a single slow nod.

“Texture improved. Still… crunchy. Flavor: present.”

Kiko translated without looking up. “Marginally edible. Significant improvement needed.”

Ilyas reached for water. “Direction: correct. Continue.”

Anri fist-pumped. “Senpai believes in me! That’s one hundred percent more confidence than batch one!”

Day Two dawned calmer. The room had been scrubbed overnight—Ilyas’s work, of course. Ingredients were pre-measured in small bowls. Kiko had recalibrated the oven. Anri arrived early, notebook filled with corrections, dark circles under her eyes but determination burning brighter than ever.

“Temperature: 175°C, not 225°C. Timer: set AND watch. Mixing: gentle folds, not aggressive beating.” She took a deep breath. “Today we science correctly.”

This time the process was different. Careful measurement. Gentle mixing. Double timers. She pulled up a stool and watched through the oven window, notebook at the ready. The minutes ticked. Golden color developed. Tops rose properly. The smell became actual baking bread instead of despair.

The timer dinged. Anri opened the door with trembling hands. Golden-brown perfection stared back.

“They’re… they’re not charcoal…” she whispered. Then louder: “They’re GOLDEN! Like actual bakery items!”

Kiko approached, inspected one, and made a final note. “Visual assessment: acceptable. Texture verification required.”

Ilyas entered on cue. He examined the muffin with forensic seriousness, took a bite, chewed thoughtfully… then took a second bite voluntarily.

“Actually good,” he said. “Texture: proper. Moisture: adequate. Flavor: balanced. Festival viable.”

Anri exploded into joy. She hugged Kiko (who accepted it stiffly, patting her head once), then launched herself at Ilyas. “Thank you for surviving yesterday!”

Kiko extracted herself. “One successful batch insufficient. Consistency required. Proceed to mass production phase.”

By afternoon Anri had found her rhythm. Batch after batch emerged perfect. Ilyas continued quality control with admirable dedication. Kiko closed her clipboard with a definitive snap.

“Consistency achieved. Quality maintained across fourteen batches. Festival preparation: approved.”

Anri stood at the window, looking out at the courtyard where festival booths were already rising. She held a sample muffin—the first perfect one she had ever made—and smiled, softer than usual.

“From charcoal to craftsmanship,” she said quietly. “Thank you. Both of you. For not letting me give up after… what was it, seventeen burnt batches?”

Ilyas reached for one more muffin. “Stomach survived. Worth it.”

Kiko offered the rarest of compliments. “…Well done.”

Outside, Sato peered through the doorway, saw the quiet moment, and—for once—wisely retreated without narrating it.

### Neighbor Noise – The Condom Chronicles (Multiple Incidents)

The walls between Unit 301 and Unit 302 were exactly fifteen centimeters thick. Ilyas had measured them during one particularly desperate study session. He had also calculated the decibel loss across that distance. The number was insulting.

Saturday evening. Desk lamp on. Textbooks open. Kiko on the bed with her own notes, chewing gum with metronomic precision. Ilyas at the desk trying to solve an integral that refused to resolve.

Then it began.

Creak… creak… THUMP.

The headboard found its rhythm against the shared wall. A feminine moan filtered through—breathless, escalating. A deeper male voice answered, low and teasing. Laughter. Gasps. The unmistakable clink of metal.

Kiko’s pen paused mid-note. “Wall thickness: approximately fifteen centimeters. Insulation rating: abysmal. Current decibel level: forty-five and rising.”

Another moan—louder. “Handcuffs confirmed. Pattern matches previous incidents logged in my observations.”

Ilyas continued writing, expression neutral. Inside his head: Again. Unit 302. They’ve been at it since last month. Mom really needs to soundproof these walls… or charge extra.

The rhythm accelerated. Voices overlapped in explicit encouragement. The window must be open; every detail arrived in high fidelity.

Kiko’s cheeks gained the faintest pink. “Your proposed podcast concept—‘24/7 Study ASMR with Authentic Background Audio’—appears viable. Potential revenue stream: substantial, given current production quality.”

A particularly loud climax rolled through the wall—shouts, laughter, satisfied sighs. Then silence.

Followed by footsteps.

A knock—urgent but sheepish.

Through the peephole: Kenji and Yuki, disheveled, flushed, wrapped in robes. Kenji held up an empty box and grinned awkwardly.

“Hey, kid—Ilyas, right? Son of the landlady? We’re… out. Got any spares?”

Ilyas retrieved a fresh box from the bathroom cabinet (Mom’s emergency stash), handed it over without comment. They thanked him profusely and scampered back. Moments later the sounds resumed with renewed enthusiasm.

Kiko returned to her notes, corner of her mouth twitching. “Customer service exemplary. Podcast episode two: live recording available now.”

Ilyas sighed into his textbook. “I need to call Mom about that soundproofing.”

“And possibly renegotiate my lease.”

Kiko, still not looking up: “Statistically, they have a recovery period of forty-five to ninety minutes before round two. We should complete our assignments before then.”

A long pause.

“…And never reference the previous linguistic miscommunication.”

“Agreed,” Ilyas said immediately. “Already forgotten.”

The integral remained unsolved.

The thumping would return in approximately seventy-three minutes.

It always did.

### Parents’ Day – Mothers & Mortification

The main entrance of Tenketsu Academy buzzed with Parents’ Day energy. Families streamed in, teachers smiled fixedly, students oscillated between pride and dread.

Mrs. Nakamura swept in like a cheerful hurricane, arms full of Tupperware containers. She spotted her twins and enveloped them in enthusiastic hugs despite their protests. “My precious babies! Look how tall you’ve grown! And Kiko-chan, still so serious—here, try Mama’s new matcha brownies!”

She immediately began distributing treats to nearby students. “Everyone, help yourselves! Growing teens need fuel!”

Sato preened. Kiko accepted a brownie with resigned grace.

Then Mrs. Kurogane arrived.

Mid-forties, stylishly disheveled hair, confident smile that turned heads. She strode straight to Ilyas, ruffled his pink hair without warning, and beamed at the crowd.

“Ilyas-kun! There you are! Mommy brought snacks—and rent reminders for a few tenants’ parents!”

Her eyes lit on Kiko. “Oh! You’re the smart girl who studies at his place sometimes, right? Such a good influence!”

She leaned in conspiratorially—volume not lowered. “Between you and me, the walls are thin on purpose—encourages ‘community bonding’! Unit 302 has been bonding very enthusiastically lately. My boy’s so tolerant, just like his dad was!”

Nearby parents chuckled knowingly. A few younger students blushed crimson.

Mrs. Kurogane continued, utterly shameless. “He’s used to it since he was little! Whole building’s like one big family—very loud family. Builds character!”

She winked at Kiko. “You two studying hard up there? Door’s always open if you need… privacy adjustments!”

Mrs. Nakamura overheard and lit up. “Your building sounds lively! We should do a parent potluck sometime!”

Numbers were exchanged instantly.

Sato looked ready to vanish into the floor. Kiko’s eyebrow twitched almost imperceptibly. Ilyas stood perfectly still while his mother ruffled his hair again, mentally calculating the fastest route to the nearest exit.

Some moments, he decided, were simply not survivable.


### The Beach Trip – Sun, Sand, and Fireworks

The chartered bus smelled of sunscreen, convenience-store snacks, and teenage anticipation. Anri had claimed the front seat and spent the entire ride waving a hand-drawn “Pudding Patriots Beach Operation” flag out the window. By the time they reached the shore, half the class was already chanting her made-up club name.

Golden sand stretched wide under a merciless summer sun. Waves crashed in steady rhythm. Seagulls screamed overhead. Vendors hawked shaved ice and grilled squid. Volleyball nets swayed in the breeze. Umbrellas bloomed like colorful mushrooms.

Anri immediately declared war on the sand. “Behold—the Pudding Patriot Fortress! Complete with moat and muffin turrets!” She knelt in the center of a growing mound, red hair plastered to her forehead with sweat and seawater, shovel flashing like a sword.

Nearby, the watermelon-splitting contest had begun. Blindfolded students swung plastic bats with varying degrees of dignity. Ryo Kaneda stepped up, blindfold secure, bat raised. “This one’s mine. Stand back, rookies.” One clean, brutal swing. The watermelon split perfectly; red flesh exploded across the tarp. The crowd cheered. Ryo pulled off the blindfold and flexed. “Heh. Easy.”

Masaru Ito snorted from the sidelines. “All power, no finesse. Watch a real athlete.” He missed by a mile on his first swing, bat whistling through empty air. The second try connected—but only with the edge. Half the melon cartwheeled into the sand. Masaru threw the bat down. “Wind interference!”

On the makeshift volleyball court, Sato and Masaru faced off in what had already become a blood feud without blood. Sato leapt for a dramatic jump serve. “The wind betrays me! A foul conspiracy of aerodynamics!” The ball sailed straight into the net. Masaru dove for the save on the next point, sand spraying. “That’s another point! Your ‘dramatic serves’ ain’t cutting it today, Nakamura!”

Under a large umbrella, Ilyas Kurogane had established his tactical retreat zone. Towel spread, cooler within reach, max SPF applied twice. A book lay open on his lap, though he had read the same paragraph four times. Kiko sat nearby in an elegant black one-piece, wide-brimmed hat shading her face, thick book propped on her knees. She glanced toward the chaos every few minutes, making mental notes.

“Chaos metric: rising exponentially,” she murmured. “Anri’s fortress has reached structural instability. Predicted collapse in four minutes.”

Right on cue, the sand mound slumped. Anri wailed dramatically, then immediately began rebuilding. “Version 2.0! Now with reinforced buttresses!”

As the sun dipped lower, the energy shifted. Groups gathered on blankets. Someone started a small bonfire (against regulations, ignored). Snacks circulated. Conversations grew softer.

Hana Moritsuka sat a little apart, sketchbook open, pencil moving in quick, confident strokes. Every few pages her gaze drifted toward Sato—currently attempting to narrate the sunset like it was a mecha transformation sequence—before returning to her drawing with faintly pink cheeks.

Anri flopped down beside Ilyas, sand still clinging to her legs. “Senpai! You survived the whole day without retreating once! I’m so proud!”

Ilyas turned a page he hadn’t read. “Optimal positioning. Minimal involvement.”

Kiko closed her book with a soft snap. “Sunset at 19:04. Fireworks scheduled for 20:00. Temperature dropping 1.2 degrees per hour. Recommend light jackets soon.”

The first firework cracked open the night—golden chrysanthemum bursting against black velvet. Then red, then blue, then cascading silver. Faces lit in flashes of color. Someone gasped. Someone laughed. Anri leaned against Ilyas’s shoulder without asking, eyes wide and reflecting sparks.

“Pretty…” she whispered.

Ilyas didn’t move away. For once, retreat felt unnecessary.

### Kiko – The Study Session That Stopped Being About Studying

Evening lamplight turned the small apartment warm and intimate. Textbooks lay abandoned on the desk. The condom box Kenji had returned earlier sat untouched in the corner like a silent accusation.

Kiko stood closer than the space between desk and bed should allow. Her fingers were still laced through Ilyas’s. Her glasses had slipped slightly down her nose. The analytical mask she wore like armor had developed visible cracks—cheeks flushed, breath uneven, pupils dilated behind the lenses.

“Current parameters…” she said, voice quieter than he had ever heard it, “…include proximity. Lack of interruption. Available supplies.”

She leaned in. Their lips met—tentative at first, then curious, then hungry. Her hands slid under his shirt, fingertips mapping skin with the same precision she usually reserved for spreadsheets. His hands found her waist, then lower, pulling her flush against him.

Clothes became obstacles. They fell away slowly, deliberately. Kiko’s usual perfect posture softened as she let him guide her to the bed. When he pressed inside her—slow, careful—she gasped, nails digging into his shoulders.

“Deeper…” The word slipped out, uncalculated. Her voice cracked. “Fill me…”

The rhythm built. Slow became steady became desperate. Her legs wrapped around him, heels digging into his back. Every thrust drew a new sound from her—soft moans turning to sharp cries, then wordless pleas. The thin walls carried none of it tonight; the neighbors were mercifully silent.

When she came the first time, her whole body arched, walls clenching rhythmically, a broken moan tearing from her throat. Eyes rolled back. Tongue lolled for a heartbeat before she caught herself, mortified and exhilarated at once.

He didn’t stop.

The second climax hit harder. She begged—actually begged—for him to finish inside. When he did, thick heat flooded deep, her belly visibly twitching with each pulse. Overflow leaked slowly as he stayed buried, both of them trembling.

Kiko lay beneath him afterward, chest heaving, dazed smile curving her lips. Glasses askew. Hair a rare mess. She reached up, touched his cheek with shaking fingers.

“Empirical data…” she whispered, half-laughing, half-breathless, “…overwhelming.”

She pulled him down for another kiss—slower this time, softer.

They didn’t speak about returning to the textbooks.

### Anri – The Thank-You That Became Everything

Anri had arrived at Ilyas’s apartment like a storm front—doorbell assaulted, bright package thrust forward, declaration made before the door even finished opening.

“I want you to have sex with me. Right now. Here.”

No preamble. No blush. Just Anri—eyes shining, voice certain, energy crackling.

She had come prepared: condoms, lube, energy bars, even a small speaker playing upbeat pop she claimed would “set the mood.” The muffins were real, too—perfect golden ones from her final batch—but they were very much secondary.

Ilyas barely had time to process before she was inside, door locked behind her, clothes shedding like they offended her. She pushed him toward the bed with surprising strength for someone so wiry.

“Senpai helped me so much,” she said, climbing on top, straddling his hips. “All those awful muffins you ate… you never complained once. That’s the nicest thing anyone’s ever done for me.”

Her mouth found his—eager, messy, full of giggles between kisses. Then lower. She attacked with the same boundless enthusiasm she brought to everything else—sloppy, joyful, determined to make him feel good. When he spilled into her mouth she swallowed with a triumphant hum, licking her lips like she’d won a prize.

“First hole done!” she chirped, already climbing back up.

She rode him hard—bouncing, grinding, red hair flying. Every downward slam drew a delighted squeal. When she came she threw her head back, body convulsing, walls fluttering wildly. She didn’t stop moving.

“Second hole filled!” she laughed, breathless.

She spun around—reverse cowgirl now—ass bouncing in his lap, demanding he spank her lightly. Each crack of palm on skin made her squeal louder. When he filled her pussy again she ground down hard, milking every drop, giggling through the aftershocks.

“More more more—”

She flipped onto her stomach, ass raised, looking back over her shoulder with bright, pleading eyes. “Back there now… fill everything…”

He obliged. She pushed back to meet every thrust, voice climbing higher, words dissolving into happy babbling. When he flooded her ass she came again—harder—squirting onto the sheets, body shaking, laughter mixing with moans.

Last round: mating press. Legs pinned to her chest. Deep, breeding-angle thrusts. She screamed joyfully with each impact.

“Womb… fill womb… breed me, senpai…!”

When he finally buried himself to the hilt and let go, her belly bulged slightly with each thick pulse. Overflow leaked from every hole. She trembled beneath him, dazed, blissful, completely wrecked.

“All filled…” she whispered, goofy smile spreading. “Best thank-you ever…”

She curled against his chest afterward, still leaking, still giggling softly.

“Round two after snacks?” she mumbled, already reaching for an energy bar.

### Festival Day – The Payoff

The courtyard had become a riot of color and sound. Booths lined every pathway. Music thumped from the makeshift stage. The air smelled of yakitori, cotton candy, and Anri’s muffins.

The Pudding Patriots booth was impossible to miss: bright red banner, googly-eye decorations, Anri in full festival mode—apron tied over her uniform skirt, hair in twin tails, megaphone in hand.

“Fresh muffins! Non-zombie guaranteed! Come try the taste of victory!”

A long line had already formed. Word had spread about the “miracle turnaround.” Students who remembered the charcoal days stared in disbelief as golden, perfectly risen muffins changed hands.

Kiko stood behind the booth, clipboard replaced by tongs, efficiently boxing orders. “Sales pace: 142% above projection. Stock remaining: 38%. Replenishment required in seventeen minutes.”

Ilyas had been conscripted as backup taste-tester / line control. He stood at the side, expression resigned but faintly proud, occasionally handing out samples with a quiet “Still good.”

Sato narrated the entire operation to anyone who would listen. “Behold! From the ashes of culinary despair rises the golden phoenix of pastry perfection! Truly, the Pudding Patriots have achieved apotheosis!”

A small commotion erupted near the back of the line—three tiny muffins with googly eyes waddled out from under the tablecloth. Anri gasped in delight.

“Babies! You survived the transport charm!”

Kiko’s eye twitched. “Containment protocol. Now.”

Ilyas sighed, grabbed an empty sample box, and began collecting the escapees with practiced efficiency. The crowd cooed. Phones came out. Someone started a chant: “Pud-ding Pa-tri-ots!”

Anri beamed at Ilyas over the chaos. “See, senpai? Teamwork makes the dream work!”

He placed the last tiny muffin back in its tray. “Dream’s getting crumbs everywhere.”

Later, after the sun had set and the crowd thinned, the three of them sat on the edge of the stage, leftover muffins between them. Fireworks from the previous summer still lived in memory, but tonight the sky was quiet—just stars and the soft hum of cleanup crews in the distance.

Anri leaned against Ilyas’s shoulder. Kiko sat on his other side, posture perfect even in exhaustion.

No one spoke for a long moment.

Then Anri whispered, “We did it.”

Kiko adjusted her glasses. “Acceptable performance.”

Ilyas looked at the two of them—at the girl who had once fed him charcoal and the girl who had once calculated his every move—and felt something dangerously close to contentment.

“…Yeah,” he said quietly. “We did.”

The last muffin sat between them, golden and perfect.

No one moved to eat it.

It felt wrong to finish the story that way.

Some victories, they decided, should stay on the tray a little longer.
