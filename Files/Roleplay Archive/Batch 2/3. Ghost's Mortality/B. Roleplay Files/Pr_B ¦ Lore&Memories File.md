# Act 1 Chapter 1 — Lore & Memories — The Gilded Cage Reunion

## Lore

### The Parallel Merge & Spiritual Energy Exploitation
#### Meta-Data
- Type: World Secret / Historical Event / System Rule
- Scope: Global
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Recent (decades ago)
- Canon Level: Absolute

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: All major factions, Dominion Guild, most mortals and spirits in merged realms
- Unknown To: Isolated mortals in remote areas
- Discoverable By: Living through the Merge or accessing sealed records

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Spirits, beastkin, humans with SE affinity, slave markets
- Indirectly Affected: All societies — power hierarchies shifted

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
The Parallel Merge fused the mortal world with the spirit realm, making Spiritual Energy (SE) tangible and exploitable. This enabled binding spirits and powerful mortals into slavery via silver covenants and collars. The Dominion Guild standardized and profits from these auctions (e.g., Gilded Cage). Public version: "Order through control." Hidden truth: Bindings are fragile against sufficiently advanced spirits like Ilyas.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Allows: Legal slave trade during festivals, SE-based contracts
- Forbids: Unregistered bindings (technically)
- Consequences of breaking: Collars fail, spirits break free, Guild retaliation

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Politics: Dominion dominance via slave economy
- Combat: SE bindings used as weapons
- Powers: Advanced spirits (Ilyas) can dismantle them instantly
- NPC behavior: Fear of spirits mixed with greed
- World state: Normalized slavery with underground resistance

- Unknown To: General public, Dominion auctioneers
- Discoverable By: Direct confrontation or witnessing her gaze

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Anyone who meets her eyes when active
- Indirectly Affected: Misa’s isolation and grief

#### Main Narrative / Explanation

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)

## Memories

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Misa
- Emotional Bias: Guilt, longing, self-blame

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Misa remembers Ilyas dying at slaver hands. She blames herself for not being stronger, kept his cloak and sunglasses, never left the mansion, and used snakes as substitutes while crying over broken promises of family/harem.

#### Perspective & Bias

#### Consequences
