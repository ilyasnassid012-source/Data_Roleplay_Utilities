# Act I Chapter 1 — Fallen Angel — Lore & Memories

## Lore

### Blood Manipulation (Ilyas's Core Ability)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Forbidden Knowledge / Personal Power
- Scope: Character-specific (Ilyas only)
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Ongoing (developed prior to chapter)
- Canon Level: Absolute (demonstrated directly)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: 
  - Ilyas (full mastery)
  - Select underground rumors ("Blood Scholar" title)
  - Auction attendees (witnessed effects, unconscious now)
- Unknown To: 
  - General population
  - Most freed captives
  - Yuno (only surface effects seen)
- Discoverable By: 
  - Direct exposure to blood-mixed liquids
  - Witnessing effects
  - Deep investigation into "Blood Scholar" legend

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: 
  - Auction hall attendees (paralyzed, puppet-controlled, unconscious)
  - Yuno (indirectly — freed via application)
- Indirectly Affected: 
  - Freed captives (liberated)
  - Future harem candidates (implied future "fixing" potential)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Ilyas possesses the ability to control blood once his own blood has been mixed into a target’s system or liquid they consume. Pre-event, he planted his blood into the communal wine supply. Upon activation (finger flick), he gained full dominion over every drinker’s body — paralysis, forced puppet movement, precise internal knowledge extraction (crimes read via blood memory). Moral code restricts lethal use; prefers efficient, non-deadly "humanity restoration." Demonstrated puppet control to free captives and leave slavers unconscious.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Requires prior blood mixing (cannot affect clean targets instantly)
- Control persists until consciously released
- Allows body composition changes (implied appearance alteration)
- Non-lethal by choice (could kill but chooses not to)
- Causes physical side effects on user (nosebleeds when flustered)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Auction power structure shattered
- Key depraved figures unconscious & vulnerable
- Reputation as "Blood Scholar" now spreading
- Yuno’s freedom directly enabled
- Sets precedent for future moral applications

### Yuno's Thought-Reading Curse

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Cursed Ability / Public Knowledge (among slavers)
- Scope: Character-specific (Yuno only)
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Ongoing (pre-chapter)
- Canon Level: Absolute (demonstrated throughout)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: 
  - Yuno (bearer)
  - Auction slavers/merchants (advertised as "thought-reader")
  - Ilyas (inferred from her broadcasts)
  - Narrator (direct recipient)
- Unknown To: 
  - General population
  - Most freed captives
- Discoverable By: 
  - Direct mental broadcast detection
  - Slaver records
  - Prolonged exposure to Yuno

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: 
  - Yuno (constant mental noise, occasional loss of control)
  - Ilyas (heard accidental lewd broadcast)
- Indirectly Affected: 
  - Auction crowd (surface thoughts exposed to Yuno)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Yuno carries a curse allowing passive reading of surface thoughts and mental broadcasting (sometimes uncontrollable). Used to endure captivity by listening to dirty/joking minds. Broadcasts can be private (to Narrator) or accidental/public (e.g., "massacre of cuteness" leak). Semi-mastered filtering exists but fails under strong emotion.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Always on — cannot fully disable
- Range: Nearby surface thoughts
- Broadcasts involuntary when emotionally charged
- Can target specific recipient (Narrator)
- No deep mind-reading (surface only)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)

- Strengthened bond with Narrator (trust restored)
- Potential future liability (uncontrolled broadcasts)

# Act 1 Chapter 3 — Lore & Memories — The Pouch-Bound Savior

## Lore

### Infinite Pocket Dimension Pouch (Chōyakusha’s Marsupium)
#### Meta-Data
- Type: World Secret / System Rule
- Scope: Character-specific (Chōya’s bloodline)
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Timeless (ancient beast-kin lineage enhanced by magic)
- Canon Level: Absolute

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Blood Market Syndicate (used her as inventory), Ilyas (witnessed during rescue), Yuno & Kokō (told during breakfast)
- Unknown To: General public, most continental powers
- Discoverable By: Close physical contact + trust (only Chōya can willingly open it)

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Chōya (used as living storage for decades), Ilyas (carried safely during escape), Kokō (tested pouch and loved it)
- Indirectly Affected: Future harem dynamics (pouch enables group intimacy/transport)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Chōya’s natural kangaroo marsupium was enhanced by her magic-touched lineage into a true pocket dimension. The interior is warm, breathable, weightless, and pulsing like a living embrace. Capacity is effectively infinite for practical purposes. Slavers exploited it as “living inventory,” forcing her to store goods and people without regard for her well-being. Ilyas’s rescue revealed its true potential as a sanctuary and intimate space.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Only Chōya can open it willingly; forced entry requires unconsciousness or specific magic.
- Living beings inside experience no time distortion or harm.
- Overuse causes emotional fatigue for Chōya.
- Breaking the pouch would require killing Chōya (contents safely expelled).

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Politics: Blood Market now missing high-value asset, increasing pursuit risk.
- Combat: Potential mobile safe zone for allies.
- Powers: Enables new group strategies and intimate bonding.
- NPC behavior: Chōya now views pouch as symbol of family, not captivity.
- World state: Adds living pocket dimension to harem capabilities.

### Blood Scholar Reputation
#### Meta-Data
- Type: Public Knowledge / Myth
- Scope: Regional (underworld & border areas)
- Status: Active & Growing
- Time Period: Recent (sparked at Carnival of Chains)
- Canon Level: Mythologized

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Slavers at Shattered Grove (recognized Ilyas instantly), surviving Carnival witnesses
- Unknown To: General population
- Discoverable By: Asking underworld contacts or witnessing blood magic

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Blood Market Syndicate (now fears him)
- Indirectly Affected: Future rescues become riskier due to reputation

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Ilyas’s actions at the Carnival of Chains (paralyzing auction with blood wine, zero survivors) created the “Blood Scholar” legend. At Shattered Grove, guards recognized him by name and power, causing immediate panic. His blood constructs (wings, scythe, lasers) further cemented the myth of an unstoppable crimson mage.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Reputation spreads through fear and rumors, not formal channels.
- Attracts both enemies (Syndicate) and potential allies.

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Politics: Syndicate now prioritizes hunting him.
- Combat: Opponents hesitate upon recognition.
- NPC behavior: Slavers flee on sight; Chōya sees him as legendary savior.

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Chōya remembers only fragments: cold bars, hands forcing items into her pouch, being called “inventory,” decades without a name or kindness.

#### Consequences
