## Timeline
### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
Before the first scene, the story is set two days after Kokō’s rescue from the Carnival of Chains (end of Chapter 2). The mansion is now a safe haven for the growing harem. Ilyas, Yuno, and Kokō have established a domestic routine after the intense morning intimacy. Unresolved threads include Yuno’s possessive harem-planning, Kokō’s lingering collar trauma, and the spreading reputation of the Blood Scholar. The status quo is peaceful morning life, but external threats (Blood Market slavers) linger in the background.

#### Scene 1 — Morning Intimacy & Departure
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary), Yuno (supporting), Kokō (background)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Yuno (present), Kokō (present)
- **Approximate Time Range:** 
    * *Starting From:* Dawn, two days after Chapter 2
    * *Ending At:* Mid-morning
- **Scene Type:** Intimate, Domestic Setup

**Narrative:**
The chapter opens in Ilyas’s bedroom at the riverside mansion. Golden morning light filters through curtains. Kokō sleeps curled in Ilyas’s lap, purring softly with twin tails wrapped around his waist. Yuno sprawls across the bed, snoring lightly after a night of cock-warming and wine. Ilyas sits at the bed’s edge in his scholar robe, writing notes on blood manipulation rules and the recent Carnival events. He gently pats Kokō’s head while teasing Yuno about her drunken slapping in her sleep. Yuno wakes, teases back shamelessly, escalating to explicit suggestions about ropes and face-sitting. Kokō stirs, nuzzling closer. The mood is lazy, affectionate, and charged with NSFW tension. Ilyas eventually stands, decides to go for a walk and write more notes, leaving the girls resting. He spots a poster about a “special inventory auction” in a nearby village and heads out alone, blood-enhanced for safety.

#### Scene 2 — Village Investigation & Rescue
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Slavers (antagonists), Chōyakusha (Chōya, captive), Lord Veil (hidden boss, background)
- **Approximate Time Range:** 
    * *Starting From:* Mid-morning
    * *Ending At:* Late morning
- **Scene Type:** Action, Rescue, Introduction

**Narrative:**
Ilyas arrives at Shattered Grove Village, a hidden non-human sanctuary now overrun by Blood Market slavers. Fighters are caged in the square; the rest are herded into a debauched victory party. A solitary cage holds Chōyakusha (Chōya), the kangaroo girl, completely nude, collared, and catatonic as “living inventory” due to her infinite magic pouch. Ilyas is confronted at the gate by guards. Using blood enhancement (self-bite and reversed circulation), he casually breaks one guard’s wrist with a wet crack and disarms the group with blood tendrils. He manifests a blood scythe, warns of an approaching High-Rank Curse drawn by overuse of suppression runes, and shatters all cage locks with thin blood lasers. Villagers flee. The curse emerges — a massive tentacled hunger entity. Ilyas engages mid-air with blood wings, fragments his scythe into razor shards striking the core, then dissolves wings into a barrage, critically damaging the curse. Exhausted and dizzy from a brief downward glance (height phobia), he falls. Chōya, now free, instinctively catches him mid-fall, pulling him into a full naked embrace and guiding him into her pouch for safety. The curse melts down. Chōya speaks her first words in decades: “…thank… you…” and “…you… came…”.

#### Scene 3 — Return Home & Introduction
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary), Chōya (supporting)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Chōya (present), Yuno (wakes), Kokō (wakes)
- **Approximate Time Range:** 
    * *Starting From:* Late morning
    * *Ending At:* Early afternoon
- **Scene Type:** Travel, Introduction, Domestic

**Narrative:**
Chōya carries pouched Ilyas home, hopping gently while rocking him, teasing about feeling him hard inside the pouch (comforting shape) and owing “breakfast in milk” later. She reflects on her decades of captivity as inventory. They arrive at the mansion. Ilyas exits the pouch, feeling restored, and leads her inside. He calls for Yuno and Kokō (still asleep). Chōya is awed by the home, hugs Ilyas tightly, tail curling around him. Yuno and Kokō wake, descend sleepy and curious. Full harem introduction begins: Yuno teases playfully, Kokō nuzzles shyly. Chōya opens her arms, crying happy tears, declaring them her new daughters. The girls bond instantly — Yuno plotting pouch parties, Kokō asking for pouch rides, Chōya offering maternal warmth. Breakfast is served; conversation flows naturally into Chōya’s past, her infinite pouch, and future plans.

#### Scene 4 — Post-Breakfast Reflection & Chapter Close
- **Character's Povs:** Chōya (primary), Yuno & Kokō (supporting)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Chōya (present), Yuno (present), Kokō (present), Ilyas (background downstairs)
- **Approximate Time Range:** 
    * *Starting From:* Early afternoon
    * *Ending At:* Early afternoon (chapter close)
- **Scene Type:** Emotional Reflection, Intimate Bonding

**Narrative:**
After breakfast, the girls move upstairs for shower/clean-up. Chōya reflects deeply on her rescue, new room, new family — decades of numbness breaking. She hugs Yuno and Kokō tightly in the bathroom, naked and emotional, crying happy tears while rocking them. Kokō nuzzles happily in her chest. Yuno’s teasing softens into protective warmth. Chōya promises to care for them forever, tail curling around both. The moment is tender, intimate, and healing. Downstairs, Ilyas finishes tidying, smiling lazily, oblivious but content. The chapter closes on this warm family embrace, setting up future mischief (pouch ambush plans) and deeper bonds.

#### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**
The chapter ends with Chōya fully integrated into the harem, her broken past giving way to overwhelming gratitude and maternal love. Ilyas has expanded the family by rescuing Chōya, whose infinite pouch adds new possibilities. Yuno and Kokō accept her instantly, forming a sisterly bond. The mansion feels more like home. Unresolved threads include spreading Blood Scholar reputation, potential Broker retaliation, and the girls’ escalating intimate plans for Ilyas tonight. The stage is set for deeper harem dynamics and external threats.

##### Overall Consequences
- Chōya rescued and collared removed; now safe in mansion with her own room.
- All villagers freed; slavers fled.
- High-Rank Curse defeated.
- Harem now four members; strong sisterly bond formed.
- Chōya’s pouch confirmed infinite pocket dimension — new strategic/intimate asset.

##### Unresolved Threads
- Blood Market Syndicate/Broker may seek revenge for lost “inventory” and village.
- Chōya’s decades of trauma may resurface in quieter moments.
- Girls plotting “pouch ambush” surprise for Ilyas tonight.
- Ilyas’s blood scholar reputation spreading, drawing future attention.

##### Relationships Update
- **Ilyas & Chōya:** Instant deep trust and attachment; Chōya sees him as savior/hero, already maternal/possessive.
- **Chōya & Yuno:** Fast sisterly bond; Yuno teases but welcomes, already scheming together.
- **Chōya & Kokō:** Maternal/protective; Kokō clings, sees her as “mama,” wants pouch time.

## Reminders
### Pending Confrontations
- Blood Market Syndicate/Broker retaliation for village loss and Chōya rescue

### Missions / Choices Made
