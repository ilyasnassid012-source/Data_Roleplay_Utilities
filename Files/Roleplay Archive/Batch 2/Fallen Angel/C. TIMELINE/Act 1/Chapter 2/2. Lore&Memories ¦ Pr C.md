#### Main Narrative / Explanation
The Carnival of Chains is a depraved public spectacle where collared slaves are forced into painful "tricks" (flame whips, hot coals, endurance torture) for elite amusement and betting. It serves as both entertainment and a warning to the enslaved. Public degradation ("shouldn’t exist") reinforces hierarchy. This chapter, it was disrupted by Ilyas’s crash-landing and blood control, leading to mass slave liberation and slaver restraint.
