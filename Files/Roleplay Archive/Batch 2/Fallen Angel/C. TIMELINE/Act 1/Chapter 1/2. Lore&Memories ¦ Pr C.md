# Act I Chapter 1 — Fallen Angel — Lore & Memories

## Lore

### Blood Manipulation (Ilyas's Core Ability)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Forbidden Knowledge / Personal Power
- Scope: Character-specific (Ilyas only)
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Ongoing (developed prior to chapter)
- Canon Level: Absolute (demonstrated directly)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: 
  - Ilyas (full mastery)
  - Select underground rumors ("Blood Scholar" title)
  - Auction attendees (witnessed effects, unconscious now)
- Unknown To: 
  - General population
  - Most freed captives
  - Yuno (only surface effects seen)
- Discoverable By: 
  - Direct exposure to blood-mixed liquids
  - Witnessing effects
  - Deep investigation into "Blood Scholar" legend

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: 
  - Auction hall attendees (paralyzed, puppet-controlled, unconscious)
  - Yuno (indirectly — freed via application)
- Indirectly Affected: 
  - Freed captives (liberated)
  - Future harem candidates (implied future "fixing" potential)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Ilyas possesses the ability to control blood once his own blood has been mixed into a target’s system or liquid they consume. Pre-event, he planted his blood into the communal wine supply. Upon activation (finger flick), he gained full dominion over every drinker’s body — paralysis, forced puppet movement, precise internal knowledge extraction (crimes read via blood memory). Moral code restricts lethal use; prefers efficient, non-deadly "humanity restoration." Demonstrated puppet control to free captives and leave slavers unconscious.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Requires prior blood mixing (cannot affect clean targets instantly)
- Control persists until consciously released
- Allows body composition changes (implied appearance alteration)
- Non-lethal by choice (could kill but chooses not to)
- Causes physical side effects on user (nosebleeds when flustered)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Auction power structure shattered
- Key depraved figures unconscious & vulnerable
- Reputation as "Blood Scholar" now spreading
- Yuno’s freedom directly enabled
- Sets precedent for future moral applications

### Yuno's Thought-Reading Curse

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Cursed Ability / Public Knowledge (among slavers)
- Scope: Character-specific (Yuno only)
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Ongoing (pre-chapter)
- Canon Level: Absolute (demonstrated throughout)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: 
  - Yuno (bearer)
  - Auction slavers/merchants (advertised as "thought-reader")
  - Ilyas (inferred from her broadcasts)
  - Narrator (direct recipient)
- Unknown To: 
  - General population
  - Most freed captives
- Discoverable By: 
  - Direct mental broadcast detection
  - Slaver records
  - Prolonged exposure to Yuno

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: 
  - Yuno (constant mental noise, occasional loss of control)
  - Ilyas (heard accidental lewd broadcast)
- Indirectly Affected: 
  - Auction crowd (surface thoughts exposed to Yuno)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Yuno carries a curse allowing passive reading of surface thoughts and mental broadcasting (sometimes uncontrollable). Used to endure captivity by listening to dirty/joking minds. Broadcasts can be private (to Narrator) or accidental/public (e.g., "massacre of cuteness" leak). Semi-mastered filtering exists but fails under strong emotion.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Always on — cannot fully disable
- Range: Nearby surface thoughts
- Broadcasts involuntary when emotionally charged
- Can target specific recipient (Narrator)
- No deep mind-reading (surface only)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Enabled Yuno to endure slavery psychologically
- Created first accidental lewd reveal to Ilyas
- Strengthened bond with Narrator (trust restored)
- Potential future liability (uncontrolled broadcasts)
