## Timeline

### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
The story begins in the oppressive luxury of the Azure Federation’s secret underground auction gala — a private gathering of the depraved elite. Yuno, a collared demi-angel with suppressed wings & halo, sits caged and resigned, using her thought-reading curse to pass time by listening to the filthy minds around her. She speaks mentally to the Narrator, clinging to fragile hope. The status quo is bleak: endless bidding, objectification, and despair. No external savior has appeared yet.

#### Scene 1 — The Gala Begins
- **Character's Povs:** Yuno (primary), background nobles & slavers
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Yuno (caged), Auctioneer, Lead Slaver, Noblewoman, Fat Merchant, Guard Captain, various bidders
- **Approximate Time Range:** Evening — gala opening
- **Scene Type:** Expository + Tension Build

**Narrative:**
The crystal-lit underground hall reeks of perfume masking fear-sweat. Chandeliers sway above rows of cages. Yuno sits knees-drawn in her small iron prison, collar runes glowing faintly, rags barely covering her voluptuous frame. She smiles crookedly through half-broken optimism, mentally broadcasting to the Narrator about the leering crowd. The Auctioneer’s enchanted voice booms — lots called, bids shouted, wine glasses clashing. Yuno catches surface thoughts — lust, greed, cruelty. Nobles circle like vultures. Tension thickens as Lot 10 (Yuno) is announced — starting bid 15 platinum. Crowd reacts with hunger; Yuno keeps her mask of playful defiance.

#### Scene 2 — The Shadow Speaks
- **Character's Povs:** Yuno (primary), crowd confusion
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Yuno, Auctioneer, Guard Captain, Lead Slaver, Noblewoman, Fat Merchant
- **Approximate Time Range:** Minutes after opening
- **Scene Type:** Turning Point + Mystery Introduction

**Narrative:**
A cloaked figure in dark violet suddenly speaks one word from the center: “Zero.” Laughter erupts — slavers mock, one tries to yank the hood. Guard Captain intervenes. Yuno’s heart spikes — fragile hope flickers. The figure says “Zero Survivors” — wine in nearby glasses visibly darkens to blood. Crowd freezes. Finger flick — mass paralysis hits everyone who drank. Panic explodes in eyes only. Yuno remains unaffected, wings & halo flickering under collar stress. Figure removes hood — revealing Ilyas, young, violet dreadlocks, heterochromia. Crowd reels: “Blood Scholar.” Yuno accidentally broadcasts flustered awe: “massacre of cuteness.”

#### Scene 3 — Judgment & Liberation
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary), Yuno (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Yuno, entire paralyzed crowd
- **Approximate Time Range:** Immediate aftermath of reveal
- **Scene Type:** Climactic Confrontation + Resolution

**Narrative:**
Ilyas sits calmly — accuses specific attendees with precise knowledge of their crimes (murders, lies, hidden atrocities). Crowd crumbles — denial, begging, excuses. Yuno pleads for restraint despite their evil. Ilyas releases partial speech — voices flood with bargains. He states moral code: not vengeance, but restoring lost humanity — efficiently, non-lethally. Blood threads orbit heads like halos of judgment. Ilyas opens Yuno’s cage first — frees her personally. Blood-controlled puppets unlock remaining cages. Freed captives flee. Ilyas releases control — slavers collapse unconscious.

#### Scene 4 — Flight & Arrival
- **Character's Povs:** Yuno (primary), Ilyas (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Yuno, Ilyas
- **Approximate Time Range:** Night streets → mansion arrival
- **Scene Type:** Transition + Intimate Build

**Narrative:**
Yuno follows Ilyas outside — still in torn rags. He offers jacket (nosebleed from flustered reaction). She accepts, presses close, flirts heavily. Ilyas admits living alone in a mansion. Yuno suddenly lifts him — flies despite his height fear — teasing him mercilessly while he clings between her bare breasts. Full exposure during flight. Lands on mansion balcony — claims Bedroom #1.

#### Scene 5 — Bedroom Claim & Climax
- **Character's Povs:** Yuno (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Yuno, Ilyas (asleep)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Arrival → deep night
- **Scene Type:** Intimate + Full NSFW Resolution

**Narrative:**
Ilyas lies on bed — warns of coma-sleep — falls instantly asleep. Yuno joins immediately — hand inside shorts — stroking to hardness. Oral worship — balls licked, sucked, nibbled. First climax — thick load swallowed & painted across face. Renewed hardness — Yuno mounts — rides brutally deep — second climax floods her completely. Collapses beside him — keeps him inside — spooned tight — wings draped — whispering endless thanks to Ilyas & Narrator. Drifts to sleep joined & filled.

#### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**
The underground auction hall lies silent — its worst attendees unconscious, stripped of power for now. Freed captives scatter into the city night. Ilyas & Yuno reach his solitary riverside mansion. First intimate claim sealed — Yuno filled & possessive — harem intent declared. The Blood Scholar sleeps deeply. Yuno curls around him protectively. Dawn approaches with unknown possibilities.

##### Overall Consequences
- Auction gala dismantled — key slavers & nobles unconscious & exposed
- ~50 captives freed — most fled to lower districts
- Yuno fully freed — collar gone, wings & halo active, curse still present
- Ilyas’s identity revealed as “Blood Scholar” — reputation spreads
- First harem member claimed — Yuno fully devoted & possessive
- Mansion now occupied by two — future “family” foundation laid

##### Unresolved Threads
- What happens when auction survivors wake?
- Will Ilyas’s blood control leave lasting changes?
- How will Yuno’s curse evolve with freedom?
- What other broken souls await “fixing”?
- Mansion secrets? Ilyas’s full past & limits?

##### Relationships Update
- **Ilyas & Yuno:** Savior & devoted first harem member — complete trust + intense physical & emotional possession from Yuno
- **Yuno & Narrator:** Absolute trust restored — sees Narrator as guide & matchmaker
- **Yuno & Freed Captives:** Indirect savior — no direct bonds yet
- **Ilyas & Auction Elites:** Judge & executioner — fear & unconsciousness

## Reminders
### Pending Confrontations
- Surviving auction attendees vs Ilyas (potential revenge or exposure)
- Yuno’s curse vs growing power (possible uncontrolled broadcasts)

### Missions / Choices Made
- Liberation choice → full freedom granted
- Punishment style → non-lethal “humanity restoration” (unconsciousness)
- Yuno’s future → accepted into mansion & harem path
