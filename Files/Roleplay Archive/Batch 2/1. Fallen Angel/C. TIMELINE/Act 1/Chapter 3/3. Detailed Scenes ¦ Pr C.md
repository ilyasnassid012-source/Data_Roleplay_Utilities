## Detailed Scene Documentation

### Scene 1 — Intimate — "Morning Tease & Departure"

#### Scene Metadata
- **Scene Type:** Intimate, Domestic
- **Primary Participants:** 
  - Ilyas — Initiator/Reactor
  - Yuno — Teaser/Reactor
  - Kokō — Background Clinger
- **Location:** Ilyas’s Bedroom, Riverside Mansion
- **Time Context:** Dawn to mid-morning, two days after Chapter 2
- **Duration:** Approximately 45 minutes
- **POV(s):** Ilyas primary
- **Tone/Atmosphere:** Lazy, affectionate, charged with NSFW tension

#### Pre-Scene Context
Two days after rescuing Kokō from the Carnival of Chains, the mansion has become a quiet sanctuary. The group shares Ilyas’s bed after an intense night. Unresolved threads include Yuno’s possessive harem planning and Kokō’s lingering collar trauma. The status quo is peaceful morning intimacy, with Ilyas already awake and writing notes while the girls sleep.

**Setup:**
Morning light filters through curtains. Kokō sleeps curled in Ilyas’s lap, purring with tails wrapped around his waist. Yuno sprawls across the bed, snoring lightly after cock-warming and wine. Ilyas sits at the bed’s edge in scholar robe, writing notes on blood rules and Carnival events. He gently pats Kokō while teasing Yuno about her drunken slapping. Yuno wakes, teases back shamelessly about ropes and face-sitting. Kokō stirs, nuzzling closer. The mood escalates to explicit suggestions before Ilyas stands, decides on a walk to write more notes, and leaves the girls resting.

**Character States Entering:**
- **Ilyas:** Rested but sleep-deprived (4 hours), calm, focused on notes, height fear dormant.
- **Yuno:** Sleepy, possessive, aroused, thought-reading curse active on surface thoughts.
- **Kokō:** Deeply asleep, clingy, tails instinctively wrapped.

#### Full Scene Narration
The room is warm with golden light. Ilyas’s pen scratches quietly across parchment. Kokō’s soft purr vibrates against his thigh as one tail lazily tightens around his waist. Yuno snores lightly on the bed, one wing twitching. Ilyas gently pats Kokō’s head. Yuno stirs, mumbling possessively in sleep. She wakes groggy, pushes up on elbows, breasts shifting under her nightshirt. She teases Ilyas about being proud of her handling liquor poorly and suggests ropes or staying awake to warm him deeper. Kokō stirs, pressing her face higher into his lap. Yuno leans in, breath hot against his ear, hand sliding down to rest possessively over his lower stomach. The tension builds with explicit suggestions of face-sitting and dual worship while keeping Kokō asleep. Ilyas chuckles breathlessly, calls her hopeless, insists on finishing notes first, then promises “whatever you need.” Yuno licks a small nosebleed from his nostril, agrees to wait but escalates further. Kokō wakes slowly, nuzzling and asking him to stay. Ilyas eventually stands, dresses casually, and leaves for a walk and more writing, kissing both girls before departing. The girls remain in bed, already whispering plans for when he returns.
