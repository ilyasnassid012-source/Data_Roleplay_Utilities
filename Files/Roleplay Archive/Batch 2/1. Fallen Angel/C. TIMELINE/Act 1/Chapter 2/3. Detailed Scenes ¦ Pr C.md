## Detailed Scene Documentation

### Scene 1 — NSFW/Intimate — "Morning Cock-Warming & Claiming Ride"

#### Scene Metadata
- **Scene Type:** NSFW/Intimate
- **Primary Participants:** 
  - Yuno — Initiator/Dominant rider
  - Ilyas — Sleeping, physiologically responsive
- **Location:** Riverside Mansion — Bedroom #1 (silk sheets, balcony curtains, fireplace embers)
- **Time Context:** Dawn immediately after Chapter 1 claiming
- **Duration:** \~30 minutes in-universe
- **POV(s):** Yuno (primary), Ilyas (unconscious)
- **Tone/Atmosphere:** Possessive bliss, lazy heat, obsessive devotion

#### Pre-Scene Context
After Chapter 1’s full claiming, Yuno and Ilyas fell asleep joined. Yuno wakes first, still cock-warming Ilyas. Her possessive harem intent is cemented. Stakes: solidify first-wife bond, test Ilyas’s unconscious responsiveness. Environmental constraints: sticky sheets, morning light, heavy sex scent.

**Character States Entering:**
- **Yuno:** Aroused-obsessive, halo pulsing, wings draped, inner walls clenching around Ilyas
- **Ilyas:** Deep coma-sleep, soft but thick inside her, dreaming research formulas

#### Full Scene Narration
Dawn light slips through balcony curtains. Yuno stirs first, silver wings twitching as halo pulses warm gold. She is still spooned tight against Ilyas, his cock buried deep inside her from the night before, softened but not slipped free. The sheets are sticky with dried and fresh mixed essence staining her thighs and his hips. Her breath shifts from slow to shallow as she rocks hips in tiny circles, savoring how he stretches her sore walls.

She moans softly, voice husky with sleep. “Mmm… still inside me… perfect boy didn’t slip out even in your sleep\~♡” Her golden eyes flutter open, pupils blown. The thought-reading curse hums — faint surface thoughts from Ilyas’s dreaming mind brush hers: blood flow equations, curse grade charts. She grins, crooked fang peeking. “Hehe… even your dreams are all science-y and serious… so cute… so *you*…”

She turns her head, presses open-mouthed kiss to his slack jaw, tongue flicking out to taste dried sweat. Wings flex and tighten around them both like a cocoon. One hand slides down to cup where they’re joined, fingers tracing the slick mess on his base. She arches her spine, pushing hips down to sink him fractionally deeper. Inner walls flutter in lazy welcome.

Her hips begin slow, deliberate figure-eight rolls. The wet squelch is audible as fresh trickle of last night’s load seeps out around where they’re joined. She lifts her hips almost to the tip, then slams back down with deliberate force, cervix kissed roughly. “Nngh—fuck yes… even asleep you’re getting so thick for me… gonna ride this holy cock till you paint my womb again…♡”

Her rhythm builds — slow, punishing drops; ass jiggling with each impact, breasts bouncing heavily, nipples diamond-hard. She braces one hand on his chest, nails digging in. Voice cracks, eyes rolling, tongue lolling slightly. “Hnn—take it… take your greedy angel… cum for me even if you’re not awake… fill me—fill me—♡”

Her walls clamp down hard, spasming, milking every inch. Ilyas’s cock twitches violently inside her, swelling thicker as unconscious release hits: thick, hot ropes splashing directly against her cervix, flooding the womb in heavy, sticky pulses. Her belly swells slightly with the volume — overflow gushing out around his base in thick white rivers, soaking his balls and the sheets. Her own release gushes around him — squirting, mixing with his load.

She slides off slowly — his softening cock slipping free with wet pop, thick rope of mixed cum following. She rolls lazily to his side, leg hooking over his hip, wings draping loosely, halo dimming to sleepy glow. “Mmm… good boy… filled me so good even in your sleep… lazy angel got her cream… now I’m just gonna nap here… all sticky and happy…♡”

She drops to one knee, wings snapping open slightly. Eyes wide, voice cracking with desperate intensity as she speaks upward.

“...wait… no no no… that voice… that *feeling*… so small… so broken… Narrator… please… you brought me my king… now bring him THERE… lead him… any way… ANY way… please… PLEASE… she’s suffering… she thinks she shouldn’t exist… she wants it to end… I felt it… I HEARD it… she’s like I was… broken… small… please… PLEASE… „
