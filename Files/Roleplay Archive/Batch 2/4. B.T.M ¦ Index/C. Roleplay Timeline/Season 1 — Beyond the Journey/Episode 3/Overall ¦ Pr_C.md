## Timeline
### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
Post-Episode 2 rest phase. Parallel threads begin with Aeba in her lair watching Ilyas's live stream, developing a quiet crush after seeing him in the Constant Library. Ilyas in his own lair, stream active, casually interacting with Lyra and the orbiting Hamster Key. Unresolved threads include Aeba's shyness, Ilyas's lingering thoughts on the Chariot dream, and high viewer metrics from prior episodes.

#### Scene 1 — Parallel Stream Reactions & "Enough Flirting"
* **Character's Povs:** Aeba's POV dominant, Ilyas background.
* **Characters Present/Knows:** Aeba (present, watching), Mirael (present, supportive), Ilyas (on stream), Lyra (with Ilyas).
* **Approximate Time Range:** Immediate post-Episode 2 rest.
* **Scene Type:** Reaction / Parallel Observation.

**Narrative:**
In Aeba's softly lit lair, she watches Ilyas's stream with flushed cheeks, fixated on his violet hair. When Ilyas addresses the Key with a casual line implying the Key is flirting, Aeba collapses in overwhelming shy panic, hiding behind her sketchpad. Mirael gently tries to revive her while filtering comments. Simultaneously, Ilyas in his zero-g chamber continues light banter with Lyra, unaware of the impact. Viewer comments explode with shipping and "rizz" memes, trending "Violet Guy rizzed her life out of her". Aeba's Brush-Key spins worriedly.

#### Scene 2 — "Library Girl" Drop & Meltdown Escalation
* **Character's Povs:** Aeba's POV dominant.
* **Characters Present/Knows:** Aeba (present), Mirael (present), Ilyas (on stream), Lyra (background).
* **Approximate Time Range:** Minutes after previous scene.
* **Scene Type:** Emotional Reaction / Stream Observation.

**Narrative:**
Aeba recovers slightly only to hear Ilyas recall her as the "Library Girl" he thought was the librarian due to her appearing near him, plus commenting on her "cool hair". This triggers a second, deeper meltdown. Mirael uses a strategic white lie about Ilyas mentioning her name to revive her fully. Aeba spirals between joy and embarrassment. Comments shift to "Library Girl rizz" and early edits. Ilyas remains casual in his lair, unaware.

#### Scene 3 — "Ba" Nickname Drop & Final Aeba Spiral
* **Character's Povs:** Aeba's POV dominant.
* **Characters Present/Knows:** Aeba (present), Mirael (present), Ilyas (on stream).
* **Approximate Time Range:** Continued stream overlap.
* **Scene Type:** Peak Emotional Reaction.

**Narrative:**
Ilyas mispronounces her name again and simplifies it to "Ba", declaring they should just call her that. Aeba hears it live and enters full existential meltdown, oscillating between horror and shy acceptance. Comments crown "Ba" as canon nickname. Mirael allows the chaos while filtering negativity. Aeba eventually laughs through embarrassment, accepting the nickname internally. Ilyas continues unbothered in background.

#### Scene 4 — Aeba's Jump & Arrival in Solar-Lunar Harmony Realm

**Narrative:**
Aeba concludes rest phase and selects a gentle creative dimension for her episode. She jumps with Mirael to the Floating Meadow of Dusk & Dawn. Small sun-puffs and moon-puffs (coexisting due to annual eclipse) greet her warmly. They are preparing the yearly coexistence party. Aeba begins helping with decorations and drawing. First Friendship Bracelet strand forms with each friendly interaction.

Aeba draws a large mural of dancing suns and moons while helping with garlands and lanterns. She secretly adds a tiny purple sun-puff version of Ilyas with his orbiting Key in the corner. The creatures nuzzle her, causing the Friendship Bracelet to grow steadily (reaching 8 strands). She feels increasingly hopeful and brave. Mirael watches proudly, noting the bracelet's growth.

* **Scene Type:** Celebration / Episode Conclusion.

**Narrative:**
Party preparation completes. The meadow transforms into a glowing celebration space with lanterns and ribbons. Aeba participates gently, drawing and interacting. Mirael informs her Ilyas has finished his episode safely (vague on details). Aeba feels relieved and continues enjoying the wholesome atmosphere. Episode ends successfully. She jumps back to her lair for rest phase, reading comments that reference Ilyas's actions and notice her secret purple sun-puff sketch.

* **Scene Type:** Action Introduction / Absurd Arrival.

**Narrative:**
Ilyas uses the randomizer and jumps into the unhinged zombie high-school verse. He lands on a rooftop, surveys the cartoonish chaos (girls chainsawing zombies while yelling about homework), and expresses resignation about wasted hair prep. He steps off the roof, slides down the wall, and stomps a zombie mid-attack on Hibari (glasses girl with giant scissors). He casually comments on scissors being dangerous. Hibari recognizes him instantly from the stream.

#### Scene 8 — Melon Soda Quest & Janitor Boss Fight
* **Character's Povs:** Ilyas's POV.

**Narrative:**
Ilyas asks for a working non-toxic vending machine. Hibari leads him to the legendary Class 3-B Eternal Stock Machine, guarded by the Final Boss Janitor-zombie. Hibari distracts with break-dance. Ilyas circles opposite, uses a scavenged stop sign as shield. He spins and throws the sign, piercing the boss. He dropkicks from above, driving the boss onto the pole for a clean finisher while sipping melon soda. He poses casually in crouch after landing.

#### Scene 9 — Post-Boss Victory & Pocky Party Start
* **Character's Povs:** Ilyas's POV.

Survivors cheer and chant. Ilyas remains resigned but goes along. Stream captures the absurd celebration.

### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**
Aeba concludes her wholesome episode and returns to her lair for rest phase, reading crossover comments and reflecting shyly on the “Ba” nickname and her secret purple sun-puff sketch of Ilyas. Ilyas concludes his absurd zombie episode, back in his lair after melon soda quest success and boss finisher, likely complaining to Lyra about wasted hair products. Both Chosen Ones are safe in their respective rest phases. Crossover memes (“Ba x Rizzler”, “Melon Soda Finisher”, purple sun-puff reveal) dominate feeds. Stage set for potential future meeting.

##### Overall Consequences

- Ilyas's randomizer jump led to successful (if chaotic) episode completion with melon soda obtained.

##### Unresolved Threads
