## Timeline

### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**  
Immediately post-Episode 1 rest phase in Chosen Lair. Ilyas has completed his flawless debut task in Crimson Vale (divine gaslight bluff ending war, Key manifestation as violet hamster Rubik’s cube, #GaslightGod trending). Quota buffer strong; curse dormant after handler consumption in Episode 0. Lyra present, softening attachment visible. Episode 2 opens with viewer-favored grimoire fantasy world drop — Eldoria Royal Academy district at dawn — aiming for quick completion → Hub Plaza coconut burgers reward.

#### Scene 1 — Arrival & Rejection of Trope
- **Character's POVs:** Ilyas Satoroshi (primary), Lyra (telepathic background only)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Lyra (semi-corporeal, background commentary)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Dawn arrival → immediate decision to bypass academy
- **Scene Type:** Exploration / Character Agency

**Narrative:**  
Ilyas materializes in era-adapted outfit on cobblestone avenue outside Eldoria Royal Academy gates. Dawn golden haze, bells tolling, students hurrying with grimoires. Lyra briefs softly: transfer cover "Ilyas Veyr", mid-tier affinity, low-threat starter zone, power-up potential via grimoires/contracts/gaslighting nobles. Ilyas immediately rejects school trope — "I am Not Spending Time In School" — turns opposite direction toward quieter alleys/merchant quarter outskirts. No visible grimoire draws subtle confusion/suspicion from passersby (universal norm here). Lyra telepathic background: notes anomaly, social flag.

#### Scene 2 — Alley Confrontation & Gaslight Debut
- **Character's POVs:** Ilyas Satoroshi (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Lila & Theo (cornered), Garrick & two thugs (antagonists)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Dawn → mid-morning escalation
- **Scene Type:** Confrontation / Gaslight Bluff

**Narrative:**  
Ilyas notices alley standoff while passing: three low-tier street mage thugs (Garrick leader, sparks/knuckles) cornering Lila (early 20s, protective) and little brother Theo (~8, terrified) for overdue protection money. Thugs threaten violence; Lila defiant but outmatched. Ilyas initially passes casually, then slides back to corner to observe, internally assesses ("Three, feels pretty weak"). Steps in behind thugs, points finger (other hand pocketed), calmly questions "What the meaning of this?" Thugs pivot hostile, notice no grimoire, see easy prey, advance aggressively. Ilyas chuckles calmly, teases "glimpse" of power, times downward gesture with old lady's vase drop (shattering beside thug). Grins coldly, suggests redemonstrating on living target. Thugs rattled (vase interpreted as gravity/telekinesis without book/chant). Ilyas sighs, claims memorized entire grimoire (rare high-discipline bookless casting, noble/archmage tier), offers "skip to ending". Plants foot, slides forward with hair spiking from friction/static — mimicking charged buildup. Garrick lunges to stop but halts in panic. Bluff peaks: thugs break — left flees, right collapses, Garrick begs mercy. Ilyas delivers ultimatum: find new boss/place, warns full squash if seen again, orders leave. Thugs flee in terror. Lila expresses deep gratitude, offers guidance, introduces self/Theodore. Ilyas reassures safety, asks library direction, declines escort, waves farewell, walks off toward east lane/Grand Athenaeum.

#### Scene 3 — Library Entry & Anticlimax
- **Character's POVs:** Ilyas Satoroshi (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Sentinels (Beard & Short-hair, entrance), Elara (librarian), various scholars/apprentices
- **Approximate Time Range:** Mid-morning → early afternoon
- **Scene Type:** Exploration / Anticlimax Comedy

**Narrative:**  
Ilyas approaches Grand Athenaeum entrance. Sentinels discuss thugs' panicked flight (speculating cause), notice serious-faced no-grimoire newcomer advancing with unbroken eye contact. Beard steps forward mid-question ("State your—"), phrase cuts off as Ilyas casually greets "Morning, Guards" (despite noon), internally notes anticlimax bluff failure risk, proceeds to public section door and enters without resistance. Guards left stunned mid-sentence — blue-balled by casual bypass. Inside public wing: vast shelves, floating lanterns, scholars browsing. Ilyas selects thick plain brown leather book (exterior carved, partial hidden "Cryo..." word; pages blank/empty to him). Internally plans gaslight prop use (claim memorization/head-words to explain bookless casting). Proceeds to circulation desk. Elara (librarian) sees full cryomancy text ("Cryomantic Principles and Thermal Concordance"), comments on choice and his non-scholar appearance. Ilyas gives name "Ilyas", affiliation "Personal Reasons, and Probably to read it". Genuinely confused by blank pages, questions if normal book with words, suggests needs glasses/forgot to see. Elara sighs, proceeds routinely, stamps borrow, hints "sometimes older volumes choose how they’re read". Ilyas internally dismisses as gaslight success (convinced her words exist), exits library with book under arm, walking calmly into east lane.

#### Scene 4 — Garrick Re-Encounter & Escape
- **Character's POVs:** Ilyas Satoroshi (primary), Garrick (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Garrick (searching)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Early afternoon
- **Scene Type:** Pursuit / Gaslight Continuation

**Narrative:**  
Ilyas walks along east lane with book under arm. Garrick emerges from side alley, searching for "no-grimoire" figure — spots Ilyas (visible book), assumes passing stranger, asks if saw anyone without grimoire (serious, hooded). Ilyas nods casually, gestures backward to library, claims saw him in restricted area (hood up, just sitting without reading). Begins walking off. Garrick probes ("Hood up? Weird eyes? Violet maybe?"), realization dawns — violet hair clicks with goons' description. Freezes, mutters "Violet… hair… that was him." Viewer chat erupts: #GaslightGod memes explode over anticlimax library entry, missed hints, "ultimate blue-ball speedrun", "bro said morning at 2 PM and still won". Ilyas internally sweats ("He still looking… cold for a second… does he have cryo magic?"), accelerates to run when unobserved, leaps behind crate in side alley, grips Key, mutters "It's time to go… staying longer will just be a stretch, and I am tired." Activates Key — falls back into Chosen Lair. Episode concludes.

#### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**  
Ilyas safely returns to Chosen Lair via Key, ending Episode 2 early to avoid tension stretch/fatigue. Borrowed cryomancy book retained as gaslight prop (blank to him). Latent cryo power subtly awakening (earlier chill misattributed). Garrick now fully aware of identity via violet hair — potential future threat/recognition. Lila & Theo safe, deeply grateful. Library entry anticlimactic success; viewer memes chaotic. Rest phase begins; no immediate next run pressure.

##### Overall Consequences
- Episode completed quickly — quota buffer strengthened
- Borrowed book acquired as perfect prop (external legitimacy, internal blankness hidden)
- Garrick routed, identity exposed via violet hair — future confrontation possible
- Latent cryo power awakening subtly present (chill sensation own, unknown to Ilyas)
- Viewer engagement spiked — #GaslightGod trending, new memes (anticlimax king, noon-morning, blue-balled guards)

##### Unresolved Threads
- Cryo book mystery — blank to Ilyas, filled to others; potential power vessel
- Garrick's knowledge — may seek revenge or spread word
- Hana in origin world — promise to find Ilyas if vanishes
- Curse dormancy post-handler consumption — annual March 21 threat looms
- Key functions — unexplored beyond portal
- Viewer attachment — protective memes growing

##### Relationships Update
- Ilyas-Lyra: Deepening bond — Lyra's fondness visible, protective tease
- Ilyas-Garrick: Enemy aware of identity — potential recurring threat
- Ilyas-Lila & Theo: Gratitude debt — possible future ally/info source
- Ilyas-Elara (librarian): Neutral-positive — subtle hints given, no exposure

## Reminders
### Pending Confrontations
- Garrick vs Ilyas — revenge/recognition threat (violet hair known)
- Curse Renewal — March 21 annual "gift" requirement (dormant but looming)

### Missions / Choices Made
- Episode 2 task: Quick grimoire fantasy world completion → achieved via early return
- Library entry: Public wing success, restricted abandoned for safety
