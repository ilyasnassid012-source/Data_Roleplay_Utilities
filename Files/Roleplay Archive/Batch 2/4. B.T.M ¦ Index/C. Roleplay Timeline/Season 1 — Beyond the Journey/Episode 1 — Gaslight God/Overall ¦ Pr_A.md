## Timeline

### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
Pre-Season 1 origin established: Ilyas trapped in 17-year curse cycle ("Birthright of Shadows") as vessel for malevolent spirits, causing annual tragedies on March 21. Isolated, stoic, guilt-ridden existence at Higurashi High. Episode 0 resolved curse redirection (handler consumed instead of Hana), farewell at gate, forced recruitment via Threshold Void into B.T.M as Chosen One. Arrived in personalized lair, met Lyra (Jester Guide), rested for first time in years. Status quo: newly hired Chosen, curse dormant, Key initializing, first performance task pending.

#### Scene 1 — Lair Awakening & Mechanics Briefing
- **Character's POVs:** Ilyas (primary), Lyra (narrator/commentator)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Lyra (present)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Immediately post-initial rest (Hub timeless)
- **Scene Type:** Exposition + Dialogue-Heavy

**Narrative:**
Ilyas awakens in Chosen Lair (dark mirror floor, pink-neon veins). Lyra greets cheerfully, explains B.T.M basics: Key not yet earned, Episode 0 (origin + recruitment) already broadcast live, trending under #BirthrightOfShadows. Audience parasocial and polarized. Key progress 8%, locked behind first performance task. Three glitched doors shown; audience-favored one glowing. Ilyas processes exposure of past, sarcasm noted (+0.7% engagement). Lyra teases jump risks (first jumps chaotic), reveals pre-filtered war-genre world. Ilyas accepts glowing door → portal to Crimson Vale.

#### Scene 2 — Crimson Vale Drop & Standoff Bluff
- **Character's POVs:** Ilyas (primary), battlefield NPCs (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Varkathar (present), Liraethiel (present), armies (observed)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Immediate post-portal drop → standoff climax
- **Scene Type:** Action + Bluff-Heavy

**Narrative:**
Ilyas falls from sky into active elf-orc war valley. Lands in crater near Varkathar (orc dragon-kin knight) and Liraethiel (elven spell-singer). Both hostile/suspicious. Ilyas bluffs as "HigherWorlder" messenger of "Divine," uses weather observation (imminent storm) + troop analysis to claim divine warning: leave valley or face thunderstorm judgment. Storm arrives perfectly timed. Armies pause in awe/fear. Ilyas walks away unbothered, delivers mysterious note ("Move. Leave this valley. Divine will claims it.") via unexplained physics-defying delivery. Both factions retreat under "divine" command. Key progress surges to 68%.

#### Scene 3 — Shelter Encounter & Divine Mirror
- **Character's POVs:** Ilyas (primary), Lirien (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Lirien (present), Lyra (voice only)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Post-exit from battlefield → storm peak
- **Scene Type:** Emotional + Intimate Dialogue

**Narrative:**
Ilyas reaches forester’s hollow shelter, wrings clothes, reflects on bluff success. Discovers Lirien (real Herald of Sovereign) hiding there — wet, furious at his bluff working better than her official attempts. She vents jealousy (real powers dismissed as magic), admits Sovereign found Ilyas hilarious, thanks him for handling war. Ilyas apologizes casually, explains gaslighting flow (weather + observation + confidence + selective lies), reframes Sovereign’s intent as belief in Lirien’s potential. Lirien emotionally hit — realizes he listed her exact flaws/lesson. Gratitude forms; wings dry in golden light, offers future help. Ilyas departs calmly into drizzle, closing door without looking back. Lirien left in awe, staring at door, processing mirror lesson.

#### Scene 4 — Lair Return & Key Manifestation
- **Character's POVs:** Ilyas (primary), Lyra (narrator)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Lyra (present)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Immediate post-exit → rest phase
- **Scene Type:** Celebration + Reveal

**Narrative:**
Portal returns Ilyas to lair. Lyra explodes with hype: 7.2M peak viewers, mythic status, #GaslightGod trending. Key fully charged/manifested. Lyra urges touch — Key transforms into violet hamster Rubik’s cube: sleepy chibi Ilyas faces (multiple moods), squeezable, twistable, always solves to ultimate nap-cheek face. Symbolism: sleepy hamster (rest after chaos), multi-face (emotional masking), Rubik’s (scrambled control, reversed chariot). Lyra squeals in delight, geeks over perfection. Ilyas calls it “boring,” floats upside-down to rest, admitting internal chaos during standoff. Lyra softens, praises presence, allows full rest.

#### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**
Ilyas floats in zero-g lair rest phase, hamster cube drifting nearby. First episode complete — mythic debut established gaslighting as signature, accidental divine lesson delivered to Lirien, Sovereign amused, audience addicted. Lair frozen in calm; next run queued but no pressure. Unresolved: curse dormancy implications, Hana’s potential pursuit, Lirien’s future watch, Key’s deeper powers, Episode 2 world.

##### Overall Consequences
- First performance task completed — Key fully manifested (violet hamster Rubik’s cube)
- Armies retreated from Crimson Vale under fabricated divine command
- Lirien humbled/grateful — views Ilyas as mirror/teacher
- Sovereign amused — indirect favor granted
- Audience metrics record-breaking — legend status achieved

##### Unresolved Threads
- Curse adaptation/possible retaliation post-redirection
- Hana’s awakened perception — may seek Ilyas
- Lirien’s lesson integration — future ally/watcher?
- Key’s full capabilities (hidden features suspected)
- Episode 2 queue contents

##### Relationships Update
- Ilyas & Lyra: Stronger rapport — genuine pride/respect from Guide
- Ilyas & Lirien: Mutual respect/gratitude — potential future aid
- Ilyas & Sovereign: Indirect favor — amusement → positive regard
- Ilyas & Audience: Parasocial obsession — “protect violet boy” dominant

## Reminders

### Pending Confrontations
- None immediate — rest phase active

### Missions / Choices Made
- Accepted first jump → war world → bluff success
- Touched Key → hamster cube form accepted
