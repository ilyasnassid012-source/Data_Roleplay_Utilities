## Timeline

### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
Ilyas Satoroshi, 17, is in the final hours of his 17th annual curse renewal cycle (March 21st). He has spent years deliberately isolating himself to prevent the curse from claiming anyone emotionally close as a “gift.” Hana Suzuki has repeatedly defied this isolation. This is the day the curse traditionally demands payment. No B.T.M / Hub awareness exists yet.

#### Scene 1 — Corridor & Classroom Confrontation
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas Satoroshi (primary), Hana Suzuki (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:**
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (Present)
  - Hana Suzuki (Present)
  - Curse Entity / Substitute Teacher (Present, true form visible only to Ilyas initially)
  - Classmates (entranced / background)
- **Approximate Time Range:**
  - Starting From: 07:42 – third-floor corridor
  - Ending At: 07:51 – Classroom 3-B ritual collapse
- **Scene Type:** Tension-Building → Psychological Horror → Ritual Inversion

**Narrative:**
Ilyas attempts to avoid Hana and reach class on the day the curse renewal is due. Hana pursues him, refusing to let him disappear again. Inside Classroom 3-B, the substitute teacher is revealed as the curse handler (true monstrous form visible only to Ilyas). The classroom is under supernatural lockdown; classmates are entranced, Ilyas’s desk has been violently ejected through the window. The entity demands Ilyas open the door for Hana — the intended “gift.”

Ilyas refuses multiple times, verbally engages the entity (“Curse-Sensei”), confirms subjective perception, and deliberately redirects the ritual target. By declaring the entity itself the “closest rival” in the moment, he turns the curse’s own weaponized shadows against it. The shadows abandon Hana and consume the handler instead. Hana, witnessing the true form during the collapse, permanently loses her mundane perception filter.

The entity is devoured; the classroom returns to normal physics. Classmates slump unconscious. Hana is left traumatized but alive, finally seeing the supernatural reality Ilyas has carried alone.

#### Scene 2 — Aftermath & Gate Farewell
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas Satoroshi (primary), Hana Suzuki (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:**
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (Present)
  - Hana Suzuki (Present)
  - Unconscious classmates (background)
- **Approximate Time Range:**
  - Starting From: 07:51 – immediate aftermath
  - Ending At: 08:05 – front gate
- **Scene Type:** Quiet Denouement → Bittersweet Farewell

**Narrative:**
Ilyas calmly explains to Hana that he redirected the curse by making the handler the target via emotional/rival proximity. He tells her knowing more puts her in danger and urges her to resume normal life (clubs, etc.). He announces he is finally going home to rest properly for once. Hana walks him to the gate but respects his boundary, stopping there.

At the gate she delivers a soft, sincere “Happy birthday, Ilyas-kun” — the first time anyone has acknowledged the date positively in his memory. She promises to see him tomorrow and, if he doesn’t appear, she will come find him. Ilyas walks away under cherry blossoms, head down, calm and peaceful for the first time in years.

#### Scene 3 — Threshold Void & Recruitment
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas Satoroshi (sole)
- **Characters Present/Knows:**
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (Present)
  - Threshold Presence (non-corporeal entity)
- **Approximate Time Range:**
  - Starting From: 08:12 – opens apartment door
  - Ending At: 08:14 – steps through highlighted door
- **Scene Type:** Cosmic Revelation → Forced Transition

**Narrative:**
Opening his apartment door leads directly into the Threshold Void — no apartment, only weightless absence. The Threshold Presence greets him, acknowledges 17 refused cycles + 1 consumed handler, declares the ledger unbalanced, and offers employment as consequence rather than choice.

Three paths are presented: accept the highlighted door (B.T.M recruitment), choose any other door (unknown), or remain indefinitely (time-dilation isolation). A mocking “normal” apartment door with no handle appears. Ilyas, sighing “Of course, right in the happy ending,” steps through the highlighted door.

#### Scene 4 — Chosen Lair & Lyra Introduction
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas Satoroshi (primary), Lyra (observational)
- **Characters Present/Knows:**
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (Present)
  - Lyra (Guide: Jester) (Present)
- **Approximate Time Range:**
  - Starting From: 08:14 – lair initialization
  - Ending At: 08:30-ish (subjective) – enters rest
- **Scene Type:** Disoriented Welcome → Permission to Collapse

**Narrative:**
Ilyas emerges in his newly initialized Chosen Lair — dark mirror floor, pink-neon-veined walls, zero external reference. Lyra greets him with practiced cheer (“Welcome hoooome~♪”), announces he is hired, and offers tea, cigarettes, a pink key, and a plastic rabbit.

Ilyas, calm but tired, notes his hair has reverted to natural violet. He reasons that with the curse source gone, his original timeline is safer in his absence. He floats into zero-gravity rest, eyes closed, cheeks rhythmically puffing in sleep — and declares rules can wait.

Lyra watches silently. She notices the undyed violet hair and the vulnerable, adorable cheek-puff breathing. Her mask softens; her internal voice admits it’s “cute” — a rare crack in protocol. The lair dims to sleep-friendly levels. She remains present, quiet, letting him rest undisturbed.

### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**
Ilyas has survived the 17th curse cycle by consuming its handler, permanently altered Hana’s perception, and been forcibly recruited into Beyond The Matter. He is now in his private Chosen Lair, asleep for the first time in years without dread. Hana remains in the normal world, aware and waiting. Lyra watches over him. The cycle he broke is delayed — not ended. The Hub has claimed him as consequence.

##### Overall Consequences
- Curse handler consumed; 17th renewal cycle forcibly aborted
- Hana Suzuki now permanently sees true supernatural forms
- Ilyas Satoroshi officially becomes a Chosen of B.T.M
- Personal lair initialized; first genuine rest in 17 years
- Shadows dormant / no longer autonomously hostile

##### Unresolved Threads
- What exactly does B.T.M employment entail?
- Will the curse cycle adapt or send new agents?
- How will Hana react when Ilyas inevitably disappears from normal life?
- What is Lyra hiding behind her mask?
- What does the pink key unlock?

##### Relationships Update
- **Ilyas & Hana Suzuki:** Isolation broken → fragile trust + mutual awareness; she now knows why he pushed her away and promises to find him if he vanishes
- **Ilyas & Lyra:** First meeting; she is softening despite protocol
- **Ilyas & Threshold Presence / B.T.M:** Forced recruitment; ledger “balanced” via employment

## Reminders

### Pending Confrontations
- Ilyas vs. B.T.M Rules / Expectations (orientation pending wake-up)
- Potential future curse-system retaliation (delayed, not destroyed)

### Missions / Choices Made
- Refused every gift for 17 years → consumed handler → forced recruitment

---

## Notes

- **[Special Moment]:** Hana’s “Happy birthday” at the gate — first positive acknowledgment of March 21st in Ilyas’s life

- **[Continuity Concern]:** Curse cycle stated “forever” ended by Ilyas — remains to be tested
- **[Meta / OOC Impact]:** Episode 0 closes origin arc; canonical transition into B.T.M proper begins

### Inventory Index

**Abilities/Powers Revealed or Used:**
- **Birthright of Shadows (Curse Cycle)**: Annual renewal requiring emotional “gift”; subjective perception; can be redirected by shifting “closest” target. (First Used/Seen: Entire episode; redirected & handler consumed)
- **Shadow Command (Momentary)**: Redirected shadows to consume handler. (First Used/Seen: Classroom ritual climax)

**Objects/Items Gained or Created:**
- **Pink Key** (on lair table): Small, plastic, unknown function. (Source: Provided by lair / Lyra | Use: Untouched)
- **Chosen Lair** — Private B.T.M space. (Source: Recruitment consequence | Use: Current rest location)

**Objects/Items Lost, Destroyed, or Consumed:**
- **Curse Handler / Substitute Entity** — Consumed by own redirected shadows. (Fate: Ritual inversion)

**Detailed Abilities/Items**
- **Birthright of Shadows (Curse Cycle)**
  - *Full Name:* Birthright of Shadows
  - *Creator/Inventor:* Unknown (ancient curse system)
  - *Use Of the Current Chapter:* Annual gift demand redirected → handler consumed → cycle aborted for this year
  - *Detailed Explanation:* Subjective curse tied to Ilyas; demands annual emotional sacrifice (“gift”) on March 21st. Manifests as Whisperers, shadow behavior, temperature drops. Can be perceived differently by observers. Ilyas discovered that by making the handler itself the “closest” emotional/spiritual rival in the moment, the curse’s mechanics could be turned inward, causing it to consume its own agent. Claimed “forever” ended — validity untested.
