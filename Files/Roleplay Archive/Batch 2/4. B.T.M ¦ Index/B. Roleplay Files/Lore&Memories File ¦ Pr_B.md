## Lore

### Birthright of Shadows (Curse Cycle)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Character-specific / Forbidden Knowledge / System Rule
- Scope: Character-specific (Ilyas Satoroshi)
- Status: Altered (this cycle consumed; future uncertain)
- Time Period: Ongoing since birth (17 annual renewals completed)
- Canon Level: Absolute (mechanically enforced truth)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By:
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (full mechanical understanding)
  - Threshold Presence / B.T.M (system-level awareness)
  - Curse Entity / Handler (this cycle’s agent — now consumed)
- Unknown To:
  - Hana Suzuki (knew symptoms, not mechanics)
  - General public / classmates (perceived as “weird kid” behavior)
- Discoverable By:
  - Surviving 17+ annual renewals
  - Deliberate experimentation and observation over years
  - Direct confrontation with handler during renewal window

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected:
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (vessel / target)
  - Annual “gifts” (emotional attachments targeted)
  - Handlers / Curse Entities (one per cycle)
- Indirectly Affected:
  - Hana Suzuki (highest-priority target this cycle)
  - Classmates (entranced as ritual pressure)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
The Birthright of Shadows is a parasitic curse bound to Ilyas since birth. On March 21st each year (his birthday), it demands an emotional “gift” — typically the person closest to him in that moment — to renew its hold and sustain itself. The curse manifests through Whisperers (audible only to Ilyas), independent shadow behavior, temperature drops, and subjective perception (different observers see different levels of truth; Ilyas sees full monstrous forms).

Ilyas spent years deliberately isolating himself to starve the cycle of viable targets. On the 17th renewal, he verbally engaged the handler (“Curse-Sensei”), confirmed subjective mechanics, and deliberately shifted the “closest” designation to the handler itself by framing it as a rival. This inverted the ritual: the curse’s own shadows consumed the handler instead of a gift. The cycle was aborted for this year; Ilyas claims it is “forever” ended — untested.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Requires one emotionally significant “gift” per March 21st
- Gift priority scales with emotional proximity / attachment strength
- Subjective perception: non-vessels see normalcy; vessel sees truth
- Can be redirected if a higher-priority “closest” target is designated in the moment
- Handler must be present during renewal window
- Breaking the cycle via redirection consumes the current handler but does not necessarily destroy the underlying curse system

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- No active renewal pressure on Ilyas for the first time in 17 years
- Hana Suzuki now permanently sees true supernatural forms
- Threshold Presence / B.T.M considers the ledger “unbalanced” → forced recruitment
- Shadows currently dormant / non-hostile in lair
- Future cycles may adapt, escalate, or send new agents

### Beyond The Matter (B.T.M) Recruitment Threshold

#### Meta-Data
- Type: System Rule / Faction-based / Cosmic Mechanism
- Scope: Multiversal / Hub-level
- Status: Active (Ilyas now inside system)
- Time Period: Timeless (outside conventional time)
- Canon Level: Absolute (enforced by Threshold Presence)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By:
  - Threshold Presence
  - Lyra (Guide)
  - All active Chosen / Pillars (presumed)
- Unknown To:
  - Ilyas (prior to threshold encounter)
  - Hana Suzuki
  - Normal world inhabitants
- Discoverable By:
  - Breaking local supernatural systems severely enough to unbalance ledger
  - Being forcibly pulled through threshold door

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected:
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (newly recruited Chosen)
  - Lyra (assigned Guide)
- Indirectly Affected:
  - Hana Suzuki (left behind in original timeline)
  - Original timeline (temporarily safer without Ilyas as vessel)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Beyond The Matter is a multiversal organization / system that monitors and collects individuals who severely disrupt local supernatural economies (curses, cycles, pacts, etc.). When a ledger becomes critically unbalanced (17 refusals + 1 consumed handler), the Threshold Presence intervenes. It offers no true choice: accept recruitment, choose unknown doors (potentially worse), or remain in timeless void (eventual forced exit by unknown entity).

Ilyas chose the highlighted door → direct transition to personal Chosen Lair. Recruitment is framed as consequence, not reward.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Recruitment triggered by extreme ledger imbalance
- Threshold offers three paths (one highlighted “offer”, others unknown, stay = time-dilation trap)
- Chosen receive private lair, Guide, and Key (purpose unstated)
- Time dilation: subjective centuries possible without physical aging
- No immediate escape once inside without system approval

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Ilyas physically removed from original timeline
- Lair initialized; zero-gravity rest permitted
- Lyra assigned as Guide; no broadcast / Pillar surveillance yet
- Original timeline temporarily free of curse pressure

## Memories

### Memory — The Gate Farewell

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Shared / Emotional
- Emotional Weight: High
- Reliability: Accurate (fresh)
- Time Reference: March 21st, 08:05

#### Participants
- Experienced By:
  - Ilyas Satoroshi
  - Hana Suzuki
- Witnessed By:
  - None
- Remembered By:
  - Both (Ilyas currently asleep; Hana awake)
- Forgotten By:
  - None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas (calm, peaceful, head-down relief)
- Emotional Bias: Hana — protective warmth, quiet determination; Ilyas — exhausted gratitude, fragile hope

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
At the school gate, Hana stops at the boundary as promised. She delivers a soft “Happy birthday, Ilyas-kun,” acknowledging the date positively for the first time in his life. She promises to see him tomorrow and, if he disappears, she will come find him. Ilyas walks away under cherry blossoms, head down, feeling calm and peaceful for once.

Ilyas remembers the weight lifting slightly; Hana remembers the resolve to not let him vanish again.

#### Consequences
- Ilyas: First positive birthday memory; subconscious permission to rest
- Hana: Permanent supernatural awareness + emotional anchor to Ilyas
- Relationship: Isolation broken → mutual promise of reconnection

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Ilyas: May dream of cherry blossoms / gate moment during rest
- Hana: Will notice his absence tomorrow → potential search begins
- Motivates Ilyas (subconsciously) to eventually find way back or contact her

### Memory — Cheek-Puff Sleep Observation

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal (Lyra)
- Emotional Weight: Medium (for Lyra — rare genuine warmth)
- Reliability: Accurate (fresh)
- Time Reference: March 21st, 08:16–present (subjective)

#### Participants
- Experienced By:
  - Lyra (observer)
- Witnessed By:
  - None (private lair)
- Remembered By:
  - Lyra
- Forgotten By:
  - None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Lyra (softening mask, internal conflict)
- Emotional Bias: Surprise → warmth → guilt (protocol violation)

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Lyra watches Ilyas float into zero-gravity rest. She notices his hair has reverted to natural violet (no longer dyed black). As he sleeps, his cheeks rhythmically puff out and sink with each breath — an unconscious, vulnerable, adorable habit.

Lyra internally admits it’s “cute,” feels warmth in her chest, and recognizes this as dangerous for a Guide. She continues watching quietly, mask slipping in private.

#### Consequences
- Lyra: First crack in performative persona; potential attachment forming
- Future dynamic: May become more protective than protocol allows

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Lyra remains present, silent, watching over sleeping Ilyas
- Softens her future interactions (subtle)
- Possible trigger for later emotional conflict / deviation from standard Guide behavior

# Season 1 Episode 1 — Lore & Memories — Gaslight God

## Lore

### The Beyond The Matter (B.T.M) System

#### Meta-Data
- Type: System Rule / Forbidden Knowledge (partially public to multiversal viewers)
- Scope: Global (multiversal entertainment framework)
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Timeless (operates outside linear time)
- Canon Level: Absolute

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Chosen Ones (after recruitment), Guides (Lyra and equivalents), multiversal audience, Pillars (overseers), Sovereign-level entities
- Unknown To: Pre-recruitment mortals, most inhabitants of media worlds
- Discoverable By: Forced recruitment via Threshold Void, contract metabolism, Key manifestation

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Ilyas Satoroshi (new Chosen), Lyra (assigned Guide), all recruited Chosen across Hub
- Indirectly Affected: Media worlds (entertainment fodder), audience (parasocial investment)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Multiversal entertainment system that forcibly recruits individuals from various realities as "Chosen Ones" to perform in media worlds for viewer consumption. Episode 0 acts as teaser/trailer; full seasons require performance tasks to charge Keys. Failure risks deletion (permanent erasure). Contracts metabolize inside Chosen, granting minor passive protections (fall damage negation, narrative nudges). Keys manifest personal forms upon full charge, revealing core identity/symbolism.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Keys must be earned via tasks — no shortcuts
- Performances must generate entertainment value (drama, bluff, emotion, absurdity)
- No direct meta-knowledge allowed in media worlds
- Deletion is final — no resets or sequels
- Guides cannot interfere directly; commentary only

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Drives Ilyas’s forced participation and gaslighting survival strategy
- Enables Key manifestation (violet hamster Rubik’s cube)
- Creates audience obsession (#GaslightGod trending)
- Allows narrative nudges (perfect storm timing, note delivery)

### Birthright of Shadows (Ilyas’s Curse)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Character-specific / Historical Event
- Scope: Character-specific (Ilyas lineage)
- Status: Dormant (redirected)
- Time Period: 2003–March 21, 2025 (17-year cycle)
- Canon Level: Absolute (personal truth)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Ilyas, Hana (partial), curse spirits, multiversal audience (via Episode 0)
- Unknown To: General Higurashi High population, most B.T.M viewers pre-Episode 0
- Discoverable By: Direct exposure (curse activation), Episode 0 broadcast

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Ilyas (vessel), family (deceased), Hana (target)
- Indirectly Affected: B.T.M audience (trending backstory)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Ancestral curse passed through lineage: every March 21 on 17th birthday, malevolent shadow spirits attempt possession via chosen vessel (Ilyas). Previous family members failed/sacrificed. Ilyas resisted 17 years through isolation/guilt. Episode 0: curse redirected to handler; Hana spared. Curse now dormant, but potential for flare/resurgence exists.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Annual activation on birthday
- Possession fatal to vessel unless resisted/redirected
- Spirits seek strongest vessel

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Explains Ilyas’s stoic isolation and guilt
- Provides backstory fuel for audience parasocial attachment
- Dormancy allows current gaslighting focus

### Sovereign & Divine Hierarchy

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Myth / Forbidden Knowledge
- Scope: Regional (Crimson Vale world) → potentially multiversal
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Ancient → ongoing
- Canon Level: Absolute (confirmed by Lirien)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Lirien (herald), high priests, Sovereign herself
- Unknown To: Most mortals (dismiss as myth/magic)
- Discoverable By: True divine manifestation, sovereign revelation

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Lirien (herald), Crimson Vale factions
- Indirectly Affected: Ilyas (accidental herald figure)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Unnamed Sovereign (referred to as "Divine" by Ilyas) oversees celestial/divine order. Sends heralds (Lirien) to enforce will. Mortals frequently dismiss real divine intervention as magic/illusion due to arrogance or skepticism. Sovereign finds humor in mortal ingenuity.

#### Rules & Constraints
- No direct harm from emotion (divine code)
- Heralds bound by non-violence rule when emotionally triggered

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Lirien humbled by Ilyas’s bluff success
- Sovereign amused → indirect favor toward Ilyas
- Valley abandoned under fabricated divine command

## Memories

### Ilyas’s 17-Year Curse Cycle

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Traumatising / Personal
- Emotional Weight: Extreme
- Reliability: Accurate
- Time Reference: 2008–March 21, 2025 (annual March 21 incidents)

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas Satoroshi
- Witnessed By: Hana (partial, last year)
- Remembered By: Ilyas
- Forgotten By: None (suppressed but accessible)

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas
- Emotional Bias: Guilt, isolation, self-loathing

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas remembers family dying one by one on his birthday, shadows consuming them as curse attempted possession. He survived through isolation, believing himself monster. Final year: handler targeted Hana instead; Ilyas redirected curse, ending cycle. Remembers farewell at gate — Hana’s tears, his stoic goodbye.

#### Consequences
- Extreme guilt → emotional suppression
- Isolation → observational genius
- Survival instinct → gaslighting mastery

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Fuels calm-under-pressure facade
- Makes audience parasocial (“protect violet boy”)
- Allows reflection on internal chaos vs external mask

### Lirien’s Failed Attempts to Stop the War

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Frustrating / Personal
- Emotional Weight: High
- Reliability: Accurate
- Time Reference: Three subjective weeks prior

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Lirien
- Witnessed By: Sovereign (amused observer)
- Remembered By: Lirien
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Lirien
- Emotional Bias: Jealousy, self-doubt, wounded pride

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Lirien remembers appearing in full radiance multiple times — wings spread, voice booming divine command — only for elves/orcs to dismiss as illusion/magic. Sovereign laughed fondly each time, never angry. Lirien internalized failure as personal flaw.

#### Consequences
- Built-up frustration → quick temper
- Deepened self-doubt → emotional vulnerability

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Jealousy toward Ilyas’s bluff success
- Willingness to accept lesson/mirror
- Gratitude toward Ilyas for accidental aid

### Ilyas’s First Key Touch & Manifestation

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Shared / Light-hearted
- Emotional Weight: Medium
- Reliability: Accurate
- Time Reference: Immediate post-return (Hub timeless)

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas, Lyra
- Witnessed By: Multiversal audience
- Remembered By: Ilyas, Lyra
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas (casual), Lyra (ecstatic)
- Emotional Bias: Mild surprise (Ilyas), pure joy (Lyra)

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas lazily poked Key while half-asleep, expecting boring result. Key manifested into violet hamster Rubik’s cube. Lyra squealed uncontrollably, geeking over symbolism (sleepy cheeks, multi-face masking, reversed chariot chaos). Ilyas called it “boring” before drifting to rest.

#### Consequences
- Solidified Ilyas’s “gaslight flow” identity
- Boosted Lyra’s investment/pride

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Hamster cube orbits during rest — physical reminder of debut
- Audience obsession with “Divine Hamster” form
- Symbol of Ilyas’s sleepy-yet-chaotic core

# Season 1 Episode 2 — Cryo Deception — Lore & Memories

## Lore

### The Cryomantic Vessel (Blank Grimoire Phenomenon)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Forbidden Knowledge / System Secret / Vessel Artifact
- Scope: Character-specific (tied to Chosen One host)
- Status: Active (awakening in progress)
- Time Period: Ancient origin, dormant until recent activation
- Canon Level: Absolute (hidden mechanic of world)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By:  
  - Elara (librarian — subtle awareness via experience with "choosing" volumes)  
  - Possibly high-tier archivists / restricted wing keepers (rumored understanding)  
  - The book itself (sentient/selective in presentation)
- Unknown To:  
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (current wielder — sees only blank pages)  
  - General public / scholars / street mages (appears ordinary or empty)  
  - Garrick and low-tier thugs (no exposure)
- Discoverable By:  
  - Only the chosen host (Ilyas) through interaction/use  
  - Rare cases of "volume choosing" witnessed by long-term librarians

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected:  
  - Ilyas Satoroshi (latent cryo power awakening, book as vessel)  
  - The book (now bound to host, pages blank to him alone)
- Indirectly Affected:  
  - Future opponents / allies (potential cryo manifestations unknown to Ilyas)  
  - Library system (subtle anomaly flagged but not escalated)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Ancient cryomantic tome, long forgotten in public stacks, serves as vessel for latent elemental power. Text visible only to non-wielders; to true chosen host (Ilyas), pages remain blank. Activation occurs upon physical acquisition by destined wielder — power transfers directly to host rather than remaining bound to physical book. Public version: ordinary theory volume on cryomancy (thermal manipulation, ice conjuration). Hidden truth: selective vessel awaiting compatible soul; once claimed, host gains innate cryo affinity without need to carry or read book.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Power manifests subtly at first (chill sensations, environmental timing)  
- Requires host awareness/unlocking to control consciously  
- Cannot be read/used by non-host (blank to Ilyas only as confirmation)  
- Exploitation risk: overconfidence in "bookless" bluff may expose awakening  
- Consequences of misuse: unknown (potential backlash or uncontrolled surge)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Politics: None direct  
- Combat: Subtle environmental influence (vase/bird drops timed perfectly — perceived as gaslight, actually latent cryo)  
- Powers: Ilyas's latent cryo awakening (chill misattributed to enemy)  
- NPC behavior: Elara gives veiled hint ("volumes choose how they’re read") without exposure  
- World state: Minor anomaly in library system; potential future recognition by high-tier mages

### Bookless Casting (Memorization Myth)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Public Myth / Noble Privilege
- Scope: Regional (academy/noble circles)
- Status: Active belief
- Time Period: Ongoing cultural knowledge
- Canon Level: Unreliable (rare truth, mostly legend)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By:  
  - Scholars/nobles (as rare high-discipline feat)  
  - Elara (references as theory)  
  - Garrick (believes only archmages achieve it)
- Unknown To:  
  - Street-level mages (see as impossible without book)
- Discoverable By:  
  - Witnessing consistent bookless casting (Ilyas's bluff perceived as real)

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Ilyas (uses myth to explain power)  
- Indirectly Affected: Opponents (increased fear when bluff succeeds)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Cultural belief: only archmages or extreme-discipline nobles memorize entire grimoires, allowing casting without physical book (often carried for show). Reality: extremely rare; Ilyas's bluff leverages myth to explain observed "power" without visible tome.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Perceived as high-tier/noble privilege  
- Non-book users automatically flagged as anomaly  
- Successful bluff amplifies fear (seen as archmage-level threat)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Combat: Thugs routed by perceived bookless high-tier casting  
- NPC behavior: Guards baffled, librarian subtly intrigued  
- World state: Ilyas's reputation spreading via thug escape and viewer broadcast

## Memories

### The Alley Intervention

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Shared / Traumatising (for thugs), Empowering (for Lila/Theodore)
- Emotional Weight: High
- Reliability: Accurate (core events), Distorted (thugs' perception of power)
- Time Reference: Dawn to mid-morning

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas, Lila, Theo, Garrick & thugs
- Witnessed By: Old lady (vase drop), nearby passersby (indirect)
- Remembered By: All directly involved
- Forgotten By: None yet

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas (gaslight orchestration), Garrick (terror)
- Emotional Bias: Ilyas (pragmatic satisfaction), Garrick (fear/panic), Lila (gratitude/awe)

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas intervenes in alley shakedown, escalates via timed environmental "power" displays (vase, bird, fake charge). Thugs believe facing bookless archmage-level threat; flee in terror. Lila/Theodore see mysterious savior. Ilyas recalls as successful improv gaslight; internally plans prop use. Garrick recalls as supernatural humiliation — violet hair now key identifier.

#### Consequences
- Personality changes: Garrick — broken confidence, fear of Ilyas  
- Relationship changes: Lila/Theodore — deep gratitude debt  
- Motivations created: Garrick — potential revenge/recovery of pride

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Decisions: Garrick searching for Ilyas  
- Dialogue: Thug escape rumor spreading  
- Trust / hostility: Lila/Theodore trust Ilyas deeply  
- Trigger conditions: Future Garrick encounters

### The Library Anticlimax

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal / Comedic (viewer perspective)
- Emotional Weight: Low (Ilyas), Medium (guards)
- Reliability: Accurate
- Time Reference: Mid-morning to early afternoon

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas, Sentinels (Beard & Short-hair), Elara
- Witnessed By: Various scholars (indirect)
- Remembered By: All involved + viewers
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas (pragmatic bypass), Guards (baffled)
- Emotional Bias: Ilyas (self-congratulatory gaslight), Guards (stunned amusement)

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas approaches entrance, greets casually ("Morning" at noon), walks past mid-question into public wing. Guards left stunned. Borrows cryomancy book; confused by blank pages, questions Elara — she hints at "choosing" volumes. Ilyas internally credits gaslight success. Viewers explode with memes over anticlimax.

#### Consequences
- Personality changes: Guards — new respect for calm audacity  
- Motivations created: Viewer attachment spikes (#GaslightGod memes)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Decisions: Guards dismiss as eccentric success  
- Dialogue: New meme phrases ("noon-morning king", "blue-balled guards")  
- Trust / hostility: None direct  
- Trigger conditions: Future library visits may reference incident

### The Borrowed Vessel

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal (Ilyas) / Hidden (Elara subtle awareness)
- Emotional Weight: Medium (confusion for Ilyas)
- Reliability: Distorted (Ilyas believes successful bluff)
- Time Reference: Early afternoon

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas, Elara
- Witnessed By: None direct
- Remembered By: Ilyas (blank pages confusion), Elara (hint given)
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas (gaslight win)
- Emotional Bias: Ilyas (smug pragmatism)

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas selects thick blank book, internally plans prop use. Elara sees full cryomancy text, processes borrow, hints at selective reading. Ilyas questions blankness as possible vision issue, internally credits convincing her words exist.

#### Consequences
- Personality changes: Ilyas — increased confidence in gaslight  
- Motivations created: Continue using book as prop

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Decisions: Retained book for future bluff  
- Dialogue: None direct post-borrow  
- Trust / hostility: Neutral-positive with Elara  
- Trigger conditions: Future interaction with book may reveal truth
