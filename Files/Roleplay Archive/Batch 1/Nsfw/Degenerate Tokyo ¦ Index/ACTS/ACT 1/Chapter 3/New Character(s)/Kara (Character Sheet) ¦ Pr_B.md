# Kara (Full Name: Kara Voss Corvinus)

## Basic Information
- **Apparent age:** 19–20  
- **True age:** ~19 (young adult crow beast-kin; ages slower than humans once mature)  
- **Race:** Crow Beast-kin (avian demon subtype; low-mid tier scavenger/predator lineage)  
- **Height:** 174 cm (tall, leggy frame; appears even taller with wings spread)  
- **Build:** Athletic-thick; narrow waist, extremely wide hips, massive plush ass (heart-shaped shelf), moderately heavy D/E-cup bust (perky but bounces violently), strong thighs, soft lower belly that bloats dramatically when filled  
- **Skin:** Warm olive-tan with faint iridescent sheen on shoulders/upper back (feather-root areas)

- **Eyes:** Dark indigo with glowing red dot pupils (dilate wide during arousal or telekinesis use)  
- **Wings:** Large glossy black crow wings (span ~2.4 m fully spread; inner membrane faint crimson veins; extremely sensitive at base)  
- **Tail:** None (crow lineage lacks prominent tail; subtle feather-tuft at lower back)  
- **Other features:** Sharp black talons on fingers/toes (retractable), small black feather crest hidden in hair, faint black tear-tracks under eyes when emotional/using powers  
- **Default outfit (home):** Loose oversized band t-shirts (usually stolen from Ilyas), nothing underneath, occasional thigh-highs  
- **Work outfit:** FamilyMart uniform (polo constantly strained, skirt hiked short, cap barely containing hair)

## Speech & Mannerisms
- **Distinct accent:** Rough, husky crow caw undertone + casual delinquent drawl (“Kra-vok!” curse, “ha… fuck…”, short clipped sentences when flustered)  
- **Switches to needy whimpering/moaning when overwhelmed (“anchor— please— deeper— haa…”)  
- **Extremely vocal during sex — caws, shrieks, broken laughter, possessive growls (“mine— all mine— fuck— fill me—!”)  
- **Calls Ilyas:** anchor, pervert, bastard, baby (rarely, shy), “the only one who gets it”  
- **Calls Lyth:** sis, succu-bitch (affectionate), pretty wings  
- **Calls Hana:** bun, fluffball, baby sis (protective)  
- **Wings flare dramatically when aroused/angry/excited; fold tight when embarrassed/vulnerable  
- **Tail-tuft feathers ruffle when happy/relaxed; bristle when threatened

## Personality
- **Surface:** Chaotic, aggressive, dominant-leaning, loud, crude, possessive, troublemaker  
- **Underneath:** Deeply insecure about being “too much” — fears abandonment/rejection, craves unconditional acceptance  
- **Sexually:** Insatiable switch — loves topping/rough play but melts when gently held/dominated; extreme size queen, bloats visibly from loads, adores being filled to bursting  
- **Emotional triggers:** Praise/acceptance → instant softness; rejection/judgment → explosive defensiveness  
- **Core desire:** To be wanted exactly as she is — chaos, neediness, violence, softness and all  
- **Humor:** Dark, self-deprecating, extremely lewd, cackles when embarrassed

## Racial Abilities
- **Telekinesis (Crow Scavenger Variant):**  
  - Strength: Moderate (can lift ~80 kg max, precise small-object control excellent)  
  - Specialties:  
    - Feather manipulation (launch razor-sharp feathers as projectiles, create feather barriers/shields)  
    - Telekinetic “squeeze” (pin/crush targets remotely; famously used to squeeze Ilyas’ crotch during banter)  
    - Flight assist (boosts wing-powered flight, hovers, sudden direction changes)  
  - Drawbacks: Drains stamina fast when overused; emotional instability makes control shaky  
  - Visual: Faint black-purple aura flickers around hands/objects; red pupils glow brighter  

- **Feather Control (Passive + Active):**  
  - Passive: Wings molt/regrow rapidly; shed feathers are razor-sharp when thrown  
  - Active: Can detach/control individual feathers mid-flight (homing projectiles, distractions, barriers)  
  - Sensory: Wing-base extremely erogenous — stroking/caressing causes instant arousal/submission  

- **Crow Resilience:**  
  - High pain tolerance, rapid minor wound healing, excellent night vision  
  - Enhanced senses (hearing, sight) — can hear heartbeat changes, see in near-darkness  

## Backstory

Kara was born nineteen years ago in the undercity rookeries — sprawling rooftop slums where crow beast-kin clans scavenged and fought for territory. Her mother died young (gang fight); father was absentee. Raised by older siblings who treated her more like a weapon than family — “use your telekinesis to steal food, don’t cry when they hit you back”.

She learned early: be loud, be mean, be first to strike. Vulnerability = weakness = death. She survived by being the most chaotic, unpredictable scavenger in her murder. Fought constantly, stole constantly, never let anyone close.

Met Lyth at 16 during a turf war. Lyth (already fallen, already soft) was cornered by crow thugs. Kara intervened — not out of kindness, but because she hated seeing anyone else get kicked when down. Beat the attackers bloody with telekinetic feather barrages. Lyth stared — stunned — then offered pinky promise: “If either of us finds someone… we share. Because no one else will want us.”

Kara laughed. Agreed anyway. They’ve been inseparable since.

Moved into the city proper at 18 — Lyth already living with Ilyas. Kara crashed their apartment one night, drunk and bleeding from a fight. Ilyas patched her up without question. She stayed. Never left.

By 2030 she works nights at the same FamilyMart as Ilyas — terrorizing shoplifters with telekinetic pinches and feather threats. Lives for chaos, rough sex, being filled until she can’t walk, and the rare moments someone holds her without trying to change her.

## Current Status
Deeply in love with Ilyas — possessive, needy, terrified of losing him. Views Lyth as sister/equal. Adores Hana as baby sister. Still chaotic — shoves Ilyas around, squeezes his crotch with telekinesis during arguments — but now craves the safety he gives her.

Tattoo absent (not succubus). Powers stable but emotionally tied — stronger when feeling safe/loved, shaky when insecure.

Sleeps best when impaled/filled — deepest, most peaceful rest of her life.

Favorite aftercare: being carried while still inside, wings stroked, told she’s wanted exactly as she is.
