# Lytha Nyxvelia Starfall Sinweaver the Third ("Lyth")

## Basic Information
- Apparent age: 19–20
- True age: ~47 (very young for a succubus)
- Race: Succubus (Low-tier / unranked → borderline Imp/Siren cusp)
- Height: 172 cm (human form) / 178 cm (full form with heels)
- Build: Extremely voluptuous, chubby-thick, heavy F-cup bust, wide hips, plush thighs
- Skin: Warm cinnamon-brown
- Hair: Light orange, wavy, usually messy
- Horns: Thick, curve downward and back like a ram
- Eyes: Bright amber with vertical pupils (glow hot pink when aroused or casting)
- Womb tattoo: Simple crimson heart encircled by thin black thorns. Fills top→bottom. Currently gains 1–3% permanent size per major reset.
- Wings: Gigantic bat-like, inner membrane fiery orange, outer black with jagged red heart-stripes
- Tail: Long, prehensile, heart-shaped spade tip
- Default outfit: red-black string micro-bikini, rose-striped red panties, black leather underboob harness, alternating red/black thigh-highs

## Speech & Mannerisms
- Distinct accent: Slightly exaggerated valley-girl + breathy demon drawl ("like, totally", "oh em gee", "babe~", "fuuuuck meeee")
- Switches to ultra-serious military planner mode when discussing sex logistics ("We have 47 minutes until your queue pops. I need 18 minutes of oral warm-up, 22 minutes of penetration, 7-minute cooldown cuddle tax.")
- Extremely dirty talker during the act, but surprisingly shy/awkward when asking for aftercare
- Calls Ilyas: babe, anchor, my little freezer-burn, gamer boy, husband (sarcastically → seriously), "the only dick worth charging for"

## Personality
- Was cripplingly shy and emotionally fragile when freshly fallen
- Now: bold, unashamed, manic, clingy, dramatic, possessive
- Sexually serious to the point of comedy
- Huge soft spot for Ilyas – becomes teary and unstable if she thinks he's pulling away
- Judges other succubi mercilessly ("amateur hour", "tail wagging like a dog", "zero aesthetic")
- Still low-rank because most of her early "feedings" were dominated → she came too fast → minimal essence retained

## Racial Abilities
- Fire Manipulation (small flames, heat auras, spicy internal temperature)
- Seduction Control (weak – only works if her will > target's; currently almost useless on Ilyas)
- Blood Pressure (family trait – can spike or drop victim's blood pressure; mostly used to induce fainting or raging boners)

## Backstory


Lyth was born forty-seven years ago in one of the lower mid-tier succubus warrens — a sprawling pleasure district suspended in a pocket dimension accessible only through certain abandoned subway tunnels in Shinjuku. Her bloodline was respectable but not prestigious: the Starfall Sinweavers had produced two Arch-Succubi three centuries earlier, but the name had faded into mediocrity. She was the third daughter, the laziest, and the least ambitious.

From the beginning she hated the mandatory "mortal seasoning" trips. The idea of going to the human world to seduce, drain, and climb ranks sounded exhausting. She delayed as long as possible, faking illnesses, hiding in libraries, claiming "aesthetic research." Eventually the Matriarch lost patience and literally dropped her through a rift above Tokyo in mid-2024 with nothing but a cheap glamour charm and orders to return only when her womb tattoo had at least tripled in permanent size.

She failed spectacularly.

Lyth was cripplingly shy around mortals. She stuttered when trying to flirt. Her seduction lines sounded rehearsed and desperate. The few men who said yes were invariably the aggressive, domineering types who flipped the dynamic immediately. She came too fast, too hard, and too early — every time — so almost none of the essence flowed back into her core. Her tattoo stayed almost empty. She remained stuck at the bottom rung: technically an unranked imp-adjacent succubus with no guild status and no respect.

After eighteen months of rejection and humiliation she gave up. She enrolled in a low-tier public high school under a human alias, wore oversized hoodies to hide her horns, and sat in the very back row pretending to take notes while doodling obscene hearts in the margins of her textbooks. No one really noticed her. She liked it that way.

Then came the alley encounter with Ilyas.

After he froze the other succubus and walked away like nothing happened, something cracked open inside her. For the first time someone had treated her like a person instead of prey or garbage. When she appeared at his konbini weeks later and the seduction attempt failed (again), he still let her stay. The sex on the break-room couch was clumsy and honest and — for her — revelatory. She orgasmed so hard she forgot how to breathe for a second. But because she peaked first, no rank progress. She fled before he could see her cry.

She kept coming back anyway.

First for conversation at 3 a.m. while he restocked energy drinks. Then for warmth on cold nights. Then because his apartment felt like the only place no one expected her to perform. One night she crawled through his window during a thunderstorm, soaked and shaking, and whispered that she'd tried three different men that evening and every single one had dominated her again. Ilyas, half-asleep, lifted the corner of his blanket without a word. She curled against his back, wings tucked tight, tail wrapped around his ankle, and slept through the night for the first time in years without nightmares.

They never had a "we're dating" conversation. It simply became true.

She started calling him pet names — babe, anchor, my little freezer-burn, gamer boy. She made shared Google calendars with military precision: "9:14 p.m. – oral warm-up / 9:36 p.m. – penetration window / 10:08 p.m. – mandatory praise aftercare." He added "ranked queue" blocks and she dramatically complained but respected them. When she fed on someone else (always richer clients who paid in cash), she came home immediately afterward, split the money exactly in half, and waited for his dry "good luck next time" before climbing into his lap.

Her accent settled into a breathy, exaggerated mix of valley-girl slang and demonic purr — "like, totally", "oh em geeee", "babe~", "fuuuck meeee" — except when she planned sex, at which point she sounded like a general briefing troops. She remained emotionally fragile beneath the bravado: if Ilyas was quiet too long she would start crying silently, convinced he was bored of her. He learned to notice the warning signs (tail drooping, wings twitching) and would casually drop an arm around her shoulders or mutter "you're still here, aren't you?" until she relaxed.

By 2030 her tattoo heart usually sits between 28–74% capacity. She avoids pushing into full Flow State unless absolutely necessary — the one time she almost did (mid-sex, 97%) Ilyas had to freeze her own wrists and talk her back down while she snarled and clawed. She collapsed afterward, sobbing apologies into his chest. He just said "you didn't kill me. New sheets though."

She still judges other succubi mercilessly when she sees them working in alleys ("amateur wing placement", "tail wagging like a dog", "zero buildup, disgusting"). She judges humans too. And yet she and Ilyas both know — and occasionally admit while laughing — that they are the biggest degenerates of all.


## Current Status
Low-tier succubus still. Tattoo heart usually hovers 25–70%. Rarely risks full Flow State because no one else can safely pull her out except Ilyas (and he usually refuses mid-game).

Deeply in love in her own catastrophic way. Terrified of losing him. Hides it behind sarcasm, lewdness, and meticulously planned sex schedules.
