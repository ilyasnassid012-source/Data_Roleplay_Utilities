# Five Connected Scenes – Ilyas & Lyth Relationship Timelin

## Scene 1 – The Break-Room Couch (Late January 2026)
3:42 a.m. The store is silent except for the hum of refrigerators. Lyth stands by the energy-drink cooler in full form — wings folded tight, tail wrapped nervously around her own thigh — waiting until the last drunk salaryman stumbles out. She walks to the counter, voice small.

"I… just wanted to say thank you. For the alley. And for not… telling anyone."

Ilyas scans a pack of cigarettes that no one bought, shrugs. "Okay."

She bites her lip. "I could… repay you? If you want. I mean. Properly."

He looks at her — really looks — for several seconds. Then he sighs. "Only once. I'm tired. Couch in the back. Don't break the coffee machine."

They move to the cramped break room. The couch smells like old instant noodles and spilled creamer. She straddles him hesitantly; he guides her hips with the same calm efficiency he uses to restock shelves. She climaxes three times — shaking, gasping, wings flaring — before he finishes. Because she peaked first and so violently, the essence barely trickles back. Her tattoo heart gains maybe 0.3%. She buries her face in his neck, mortified.

When it's over she dresses quickly, mutters "sorry" and flees through the employee exit. He texts her twenty minutes later from the register: "You left your hoodie. Smells like cinnamon." She never asks for it back.

## Scene 2 – The Typhoon Night (Mid-March 2026)
Rain hammers the window like gunfire. Ilyas is half-asleep on his futon when the glass slides open. A soaked succubus flops inside, wings dripping, tail dragging. She stands there shivering.

"I tried three guys tonight," she says, voice cracking. "All of them flipped it. Pinned me. Came first again. I'm… useless."

He doesn't sit up. Just lifts one corner of the blanket. "Get in before you flood the floor."

She crawls under, presses her cold body against his back, wings tucking tight. Her tail curls around his ankle like an anchor. For the first time in years she falls asleep without crying. He wakes up at 5:50 a.m. to her soft snoring and the faint smell of cinnamon in his pillow. He doesn't move until the alarm.

## Scene 3 – Grocery Run & Calendar War (July 2026)
They stand in the fluorescent hell of a late-night supermarket. Lyth pushes the cart, adding five packs of spicy ramen while dictating.

"Okay so tonight: 9:14 p.m. oral warm-up, nine minutes. 9:23 p.m. missionary penetration window, fourteen minutes. 9:37 p.m. doggy for power buildup. 9:51 p.m. I ride until 92% tattoo warning, then you freeze my clit to reset the charge. 10:08 p.m. mandatory praise aftercare with cuddles."

Ilyas drops a bag of frozen gyoza into the cart. "I have ranked at 10."

She gasps theatrically. "You're scheduling around a video game instead of my pussy?!"

"It's platinum promo."

She pouts, dramatic. "…Fine. But you title the shared calendar 'Essence Replenishment & Noodle Refueling.' And I get the extra chashu pork."

He nods once. She doodles little hearts on every cup ramen package with a red Sharpie while they wait in line.

## Scene 4 – The Almost-Flow Night (February 2027)
They're in the middle of sex on the living-room floor — her riding him, wings half-spread, tattoo glowing bright crimson at 97%. Her eyes suddenly blank. The heart pulses violently. She snarls, claws raking down his chest, hips slamming harder, draining starting to pull at his actual life force.

Ilyas grabs both horns, yanks her face down until their foreheads touch. "Lyth. Look at me. Not yet."

She growls, fighting. He freezes her wrists together behind her back with a crackle of ice, forces eye contact. Voice calm, almost bored: "Breathe. You promised ramen after. Extra spicy. You want it cold?"

Her whole body shudders. The glow flickers. She orgasms hard enough to crack one floorboard, tattoo resetting in a burst of heat. She collapses onto his chest, sobbing apologies, wings trembling.

"I could've killed you…"

"You didn't." He strokes one horn absently. "New sheets though. And you owe me two packs of ramen."

She laughs through tears, presses her face into his neck, and doesn't let go for an hour.

## Scene 5 – Routine in 2030 (February 5, 2030)
Living room, 8:47 p.m. Lyth is draped across Ilyas on the couch, tail around his ankle, wings half-covering them like a blanket. A trashy romance drama plays on the TV. She narrates their post-episode schedule without looking away from the screen.

"Episode ends at 9:22. We start at 9:24 — twelve minutes missionary to build charge slow, nine minutes doggy for deeper drain control, then I ride until 92% warning. You freeze my clit for reset. 10:03 p.m. praise-kink cooldown with extra forehead kisses. 10:11 p.m. ramen break. Then round two if my tattoo hits 78% or higher."

Ilyas doesn't look up from his Switch. "You forgot the three-minute cuddle-tax buffer before I queue again."

She beams, tail tightening happily. "You remembered!!"

She leans over, kisses his temple softly. Voice drops to something small and real.

"…Love you, anchor."

He exhales through his nose, small smile tugging at his mouth. "Yeah. Don't die of ramen overdose before I hit GM."

She laughs — bright, manic, hers — and pulls him closer. The drama reaches its confession scene. Her tattoo pulses faintly at 64%. The calendar notification pings on both phones at once:

Essence Replenishment & Noodle Refueling – now.

Neither of them moves to turn it off just yet.
