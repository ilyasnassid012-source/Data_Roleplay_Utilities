## Timeline
### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
The chapter opens the morning after Act I Chapter 2’s intense night. Ilyas has left the mansion for groceries and a walk, while Akane cleans the aftermath alone — reflecting fondly on his return and daydreaming about future harem members as protective “big sister”. Meanwhile Ilyas wanders far off course and stumbles into the Slave Festival on the kingdom outskirts.

#### Scene 1 — Festival Chaos & Yuki’s Liberation
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary), Yuki (secondary emotional focus), Akane (distant parallel reflection)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Yuki (present, newly freed), Hidden Master / Curse Entity (present, antagonist), Announcer (present), Masked Nobles & Guards (present then frozen/fled), Akane (distant, unaware)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late morning → midday
- **Scene Type:** Action-Heavy + Emotional Turning Point

**Narrative:**
Ilyas arrives at the Slave Festival outskirts while being chased by a massive curse-beast. He casually dodges tentacles, vaults over guards, and stops in the center square — still holding groceries — asking the Announcer where he is. The crowd erupts into betting frenzy. Ilyas spots Yuki in her cage (collared, tails bound, malnourished three-tailed snow fox-kin). He walks straight to her cage, calls her “Snowdin”, shatters the lock with cursed strength, then nullifies and destroys her lifelong suppression collar. Yuki’s frost affinity awakens explosively — freezing guards and parts of the square. The Hidden Master (revealed as the same curse Ilyas sealed years ago in an apple) emerges, spawning shadow clones. Ilyas uses inverted null technique + Yuki synergy to destroy the clones, then kicks and flash-freezes the curse vessel. In desperation the curse attempts to possess Yuki via a black thread — Ilyas moves at blinding speed (hair flickering/glowing), drops the null-zone to let frost surge in, freezes the vessel solid, then activates reversed nullification focused on an onion from his groceries — pulling/sealing the curse entity inward layer by layer. The festival collapses into frozen ruin.

#### Scene 2 — Walk Home & Yuki Joins
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary), Yuki (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Yuki, Akane (distant)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Midday → late afternoon
- **Scene Type:** Quiet Bonding / Travel

**Narrative:**
Ilyas pockets the sealed onion and starts walking home along the riverside path. Yuki follows close behind — shy at first, then matching his pace. He casually accepts her coming along (“There is space”). Yuki asks innocent questions about his nullification; Ilyas explains it simply as “curving paths for magic like a river”. Yuki expresses desire to learn and stay with him. They near the mansion; Yuki grows quietly excited about warm food and meeting “big sister”.

#### Scene 3 — Mansion Reunion & Akane-Yuki Introduction
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (entry), Akane (primary emotional), Yuki (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Akane, Yuki
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late afternoon
- **Scene Type:** Domestic Chaos + First Meeting

**Narrative:**
Ilyas opens the door to a smoke-filled kitchen — Akane has catastrophically failed to cook breakfast (burnt everything). She leaps into his arms, burying her face in his chest, calling him “savior of food”. She notices Yuki hiding behind him, instantly switches to protective big-sister mode — complimenting her tails, welcoming her warmly. Yuki introduces herself softly (“Yuki…”). Ilyas heads to basement to store the onion among his existing sealed collection. Akane & Yuki left alone — Akane comforts shy Yuki, teases about burnt food, offers sisterly affection.

#### Scene 4 — Kitchen Bonding & Scent Conversation
- **Character's Povs:** Akane (primary), Yuki (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Akane, Yuki
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late afternoon
- **Scene Type:** Intimate Comedy + Emotional Bonding

**Narrative:**
While cleaning, Yuki innocently notes Akane smells strongly of Ilyas — specifically “like semen” (from past exposure to slavers). Akane chokes, blushes furiously, almost blurts explicit details but catches herself. She then shamelessly confesses how good sex with Ilyas felt — “melt-your-spine good”, “he’s intense and gentle and big”. Yuki listens without judgment, only quiet curiosity. Akane softens, reassures Yuki she’s safe and part of the family now.

#### Scene 5 — Ilyas Returns & Breakfast Rescue
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary), Akane & Yuki (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas, Akane, Yuki
- **Approximate Time Range:** Approaching evening
- **Scene Type:** Domestic Comedy + Teasing

**Narrative:**
Ilyas returns from basement, teases Akane about her cooking (“don’t let Akane cook”), praises Yuki’s butter-spreading skills, kisses Akane’s cheek (flustering her). Yuki watches wide-eyed, quietly content. Breakfast is completed together — edible, warm, buttered perfectly. Light teasing flows; Akane jokingly blames Ilyas for Yuki’s newfound honesty.

#### Scene 6 — Bath & Pool Bonding (Girls Only)
- **Character's Povs:** Akane (primary), Yuki (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Akane, Yuki
- **Approximate Time Range:** Evening
- **Scene Type:** Intimate Comedy + Sisterly Bonding

**Narrative:**
After dinner cleanup, Akane takes Yuki to the bathroom for a bath. Both naked, Akane washes Yuki with casual intimacy. Yuki comments on Akane’s jiggling breasts — wonders if it’s because Ilyas touches them a lot. Akane shamelessly confirms (“he grabs them, squeezes them, fucks them — he’s obsessed”). Yuki states she wants to feel that with Ilyas someday. Akane reassures her gently. They transition to the indoor heated pool — both naked, Akane drops towel immediately, Yuki follows after brief pause. Akane teases crudely about future group scenarios; Yuki listens, tails curling happily.

#### Scene 7 — Hallway Peek & Couch Cuddles (Ending)
- **Character's Povs:** Akane (primary), Yuki (secondary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Akane, Yuki, Ilyas (sleeping, observed)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late night
- **Scene Type:** Tender Bonding + Final Question

**Narrative:**
After pool, both wrapped loosely (Akane barely), they pass Ilyas’s room. Door cracked; he sleeps peacefully. They peek — Akane teases softly about crawling in. They continue to living room couch — cuddling naked under blankets. Yuki quietly asks if, when more girls join, they can all “be with Snowdin-Chan at once… all of us… together… on him… one night”. Akane freezes — then grins wickedly, thighs pressing together, getting visibly horny. She giggles, confesses she’s “100% in”, describes the fantasy vividly (“all of us dripping wet and desperate… making him cum until he forgets his name”). Ends with Akane nuzzling Yuki, both drifting toward sleep, plotting future “overwhelm him” night.

#### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**
The chapter closes late at night on the living room couch. Akane & Yuki curled together — naked, comfortable, tails entwined. Ilyas sleeps upstairs — unaware of the growing harem conspiracy. The curse onion is sealed in the basement collection. The mansion feels like a real home for the first time — warm, chaotic, full of promise and quiet scheming.

##### Overall Consequences
- Curse entity sealed (temporary, in onion) — major threat neutralized for now
- Yuki fully liberated, collared removed, frost affinity awakened & under growing control
- Harem seed firmly planted — Yuki chooses Ilyas, Akane enthusiastically supports group dynamic & future “gang night”
- Akane-Yuki sisterly bond established — deep trust, shameless openness, shared affection for Ilyas
- Festival destroyed/frozen — news will spread, potential future consequences

##### Unresolved Threads
- Onion seal stability — curse may eventually attempt breakout (past apple precedent)
- Yuki’s full integration — learning to live freely, deepening relationship with Ilyas
- Akane’s cooking trauma — comedic future gag potential
- Word of festival destruction spreading — possible kingdom attention or revenge
- Potential new girls — foreshadowed by both Akane & Yuki

##### Relationships Update
- Ilyas & Akane: Deepened intimacy (morning sex referenced), playful trust, domestic partnership
- Ilyas & Yuki: Strong emotional anchor — liberator, protector, chosen partner; Yuki openly wants him sexually when ready
- Akane & Yuki: Instant big-sister/little-sister dynamic — shameless openness, protective affection, shared horniness/planning
- Group (Ilyas-Akane-Yuki): Functional poly seed — acceptance, teasing, warmth, future group scenarios already fantasized

## Reminders

- Kingdom fallout from destroyed Slave Festival — potential investigation or revenge

### Missions / Choices Made
- Ilyas chose to liberate Yuki → gained loyal companion & frost synergy
