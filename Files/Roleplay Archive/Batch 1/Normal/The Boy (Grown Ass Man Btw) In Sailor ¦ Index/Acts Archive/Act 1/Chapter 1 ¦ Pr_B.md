## Timeline
### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
Ilyas Sokara, imprisoned for 4 years in Ironbelly Depths (Sealed Dominion mirror-realm), is genuinely released by the Warden after declining an operative recruitment offer. He reaffirms his role protecting the sailor suit (both inside and outside prison) and his existing place to return to. The world outside remains human-supremacist with collars, enslaved non-humans, Wild Zones, and Dominion eyes watching loose threads. No tricks or extensions—freedom is real, but dangerous.

#### Scene 1 — Warden's Office Release
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary), Warden (observing)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Warden (present)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Afternoon → late afternoon
- **Scene Type:** Dialogue-Heavy, Decision Point

**Narrative:**
Ilyas sits opposite the Warden, arms crossed, empty milk carton discarded. He calmly refuses the Warden's offer to become a world-fixing operative, asserting lifelong guardianship of his sailor suit and a place to return to. The Warden accepts without pressure—parchment signed, genuine release confirmed. No escort, no collar. Door opens outward. Warden warns: Dominion will see him as a loose thread. Ilyas takes the document and leaves.

#### Scene 2 — Coastal Path to Saltharbor
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Old Fisherman (warning), Smuggler Group (murmuring)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late afternoon
- **Scene Type:** Exploration, World-Building

**Narrative:**
Ilyas walks the salt-crusted path, breathing fresh air after years of prison damp. Mutters navigation ("3 Nebula stars South" or perpendicular to sun). Old Fisherman warns of wolves and gives star advice. Smugglers gossip about "Violet" who walked out of the belly without collar. Village smoke rises—Saltharbor ahead. Eyes follow the sailor suit.

#### Scene 3 — Path Fork & Nobles' Laughter
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Higher-Rank Nobles (laughing about Veyris mansion party)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Dusk falling
- **Scene Type:** Foreshadowing, Discovery

**Narrative:**
Path splits—left to village, right into woods toward mountains. Nobles laugh about Veyris's slave party at hidden river mansion (collars, prototypes, depravity). Ilyas realizes it's his own home—paid to protect while imprisoned. Fury masked, he walks right, bumps nobles (solid physique staggers them), mutters about host learning to swim.

#### Scene 4 — Window Breach & Party Disruption
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Veyris (host), Head Slaver, party guests, slaves (bound)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Moonrise
- **Scene Type:** Action, Liberation

**Narrative:**
Ilyas throws unconscious nobles through grand hall window. Heads in, mocks absent guards ("But Nobody Came"). Declares ownership ("This place is mine"). Slavers laugh → charge with firebolts → attacks fizzle in Nullification Zone. Ilyas walks forward unharmed, aura voiding (hollow eyes, void hair/skin, anchor rings, trails/clones). Throws Veyris and head slaver, dodges guards (collide/kick down). Commands no escape, cleanup. Asks slave count → Akane answers "twenty-three." Claps → Focused Nullification collapses all non-slaves unconscious.

#### Scene 5 — Liberation & Departure
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), 23 freed slaves (including Akane)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late night → early morning
- **Scene Type:** Catharsis, Resolution

**Narrative:**
Ilyas breaks collars—Akane first, then all 23. Reassures Akane (not her fault, deep sleeper, unfair capture). Tells slaves to leave kingdom, seek non-human villages (mention Ilyas & cheetah lady). Offers river body drop (bodies already in water). Akane stays; others depart with gratitude. Ilyas finishes cleanup.

#### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**
Mansion quiet—oppressors struggling downstream in river. 22 slaves en route to safety. Akane remains. Ilyas cooks breakfast after years of slop. Akane dozes on couch—deep sleeper as ever. Sun rises. Home reclaimed. New day begins.

##### Overall Consequences
- Ilyas free after 4 years, reclaims hidden mansion
- Veyris's party destroyed; oppressors humiliated in river
- 23 slaves liberated (collars broken, free to flee)
- Akane stays with Ilyas (guilt easing, sibling-like bond reaffirmed)
- World outside remains dangerous (Dominion eyes, human supremacy)

##### Unresolved Threads
- River survivors (Veyris et al.) may seek revenge/recovery
- Dominion notice of missing high-rank noble + prison escapee
- Akane's future (guilt, deep-sleep vulnerability, relationship with Ilyas)
- Safe villages & cheetah lady contact (will 22 arrive safely?)
- Mansion security (broken window, potential trackers)

##### Relationships Update
- Ilyas & Akane: Deepened trust + sibling dynamic; she stays despite guilt
- Ilyas & freed slaves: Gratitude & loyalty (promise to return if needed)
- Ilyas & Veyris: Direct enmity (thrown into river, home stolen)
- Akane & mansion: Failed protector → welcomed resident

## Reminders
### Pending Confrontations
- Veyris & survivors vs Ilyas (potential revenge arc)
- Dominion hunters vs escaped "loose thread" Ilyas

### Missions / Choices Made
- Declined Warden operative offer → genuine freedom
- Chose to reclaim home violently → liberated 23 slaves
- Directed slaves to safety → Akane stayed

- **[Unusual Behavior]:** Akane's deep sleep returns immediately after trauma
- **[Continuity Concern]:** River survivors may return with reinforcements
- **[Meta / OOC Impact]:** Chapter ends on quiet domestic note after violence

- Indirectly Affected: Non-human populations (constant threat of capture), free villages (refugees from escapes)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Massive underground/mirror-realm prison complex run by Sealed Dominion. Designed to contain non-humans and dissidents indefinitely. Sentences often extended arbitrarily; release extremely rare. Warden holds near-absolute power but follows Dominion protocols. Collars suppress magic/mana for most inmates.

## Detailed Scene Documentation

### Scene 1 — [Combat / Action] — "Window Breach & Initial Disruption"

#### Scene Metadata

- **Primary Participants:** 
  - Ilyas Sokara — Initiator / Aggressor
  - Lord Veyris — Host / Primary Target
  - Head Slaver — Secondary Target / Commander
  - Hall Guards (6) — Enforcers
  - Party Guests — Observers / Panic Element
  - Bound Slaves (23, including Akane) — Witnesses / Future Beneficiaries

- **Time Context:** Moonrise — immediately after path confrontation
- **Duration:** ~2–3 minutes in-universe
- **POV(s):** Primarily Ilyas (external action focus)
- **Tone/Atmosphere:** Sudden violence, shock, decadent space turned battlefield

#### Pre-Scene Context
Ilyas has discovered his own hidden river mansion is being used by Lord Veyris for a depraved slave party. After bumping nobles on the path and muttering threats, he throws two unconscious nobles through the grand hall window as dramatic entry. The party is in full swing—music, wine, chained slaves along walls, Veyris holding a chained victim, head slaver managing collars/bidding. Guards are posted but absent from perimeter (prior unseen takedown implied). Stakes: Ilyas reclaims his home, frees slaves, punishes usurpers. He knows this is his residence (paid to protect during imprisonment); no one else does.

**Character States Entering:**
- **Ilyas Sokara:** Physically fresh from release, mentally furious over home violation, Nullification Zone (unfocused) already active, aura beginning to void.
- **Lord Veyris:** Confident host, holding chain, Celestial prototype ready, believes mansion is his for centuries.
- **Head Slaver:** Professional, whip in hand, collars under control.
- **Hall Guards:** Armored, swords drawn, mana-enhanced.
- **Bound Slaves (incl. Akane):** Collared, hopeless, Akane recognizes Ilyas instantly.

#### Full Scene Narration

##### Opening Beat
Glass explodes inward—shards rain like deadly snow across marble. Two bodies (silk-clad noble & armored companion) hit floor hard—unconscious, bleeding from heads. Music stutters to silence. Wine glasses freeze mid-raise. Guests turn as one. Veyris’s smile falters—eyes narrowing at the broken window. Ilyas pops his head through shattered frame—half-lidded eyes, widening grin.

Ilyas (mocking): “But Nobody Came.”

##### Progression — Turn 1
Veyris (velvet, edged): “...And who exactly invited the entertainment through the window?”

Head Slaver (barking): “Guards! Secure him. Gently. Lord wants him breathing.”

Six armored guards rush from side doors—swords drawn, mana flaring in palms. Guests back away—silk rustling. Bound slaves tense—chains rattle. Akane’s eyes lock on Ilyas—hope flickering behind shame.

##### Progression — Turn 2
Ilyas steps fully inside—casual landing, no stumble. Grins wider.

Ilyas (grinning): “Hope you Know How to swim. Since we Going For a lesson.”

He glances around—sees slaves, notices Akane trying to look away (embarrassed). Calm, thoughtful, holding laugh:

Ilyas: “uh..., how many is now? In total.”

##### Progression — Turn 3
Akane (instant whisper): “Twenty-three... total... twenty-three of us...”

Head Slaver (whip cracking): “Silence!”

Veyris (cold): “Let him speak. I want to hear how many he thinks are here... before we show him.”

##### Progression — Turn 4
Ilyas (grinning): “Plot Twist. This Place Is Mine, Officially Registered, and You are the Tresspaser.”

Laughter erupts—cruel, incredulous. Guests exchange glances. Veyris’s smile twists.

Veyris (amused): “Yours? Officially registered? Charming delusion.”

Head Slaver (mocking): “He thinks he's the owner! Guards—subdue him.”

##### Progression — Turn 5
Guards charge—mana flaring red in palms. Firebolts form—hissing projectiles streak toward Ilyas.

Ilyas (calm): “Magic Is Overatted.”

Firebolts land—then fizzle into nothing. Mana dissipates like smoke in void. Collars on slaves flicker—then dim. Guards stumble—enchantments dying.

Ilyas (mock gentle): “What wrong?.. Did you Forget How to Use Magic?.”

##### Climax / Peak Moment
Ilyas closes eyes—then opens them. Void intensifies—rings spin to head, trails/clones multiply. One step—ground presses. He launches—blur of violet and void. Veyris’s arm caught—steel grip on silk. Pulled. Thrown. Veyris crashes into wall under broken window—stone cracks, dust falls. Chain slips free.

Ilyas (to Veyris): “What about The Swimming Lesson, do you know how?.”

Head slaver lunges—blade raised. Ilyas catches arm, spins, throws him atop Veyris—both tumble. Guards charge—Ilyas dodges, makes two collide (metal clangs), blocks one sword with leg, kicks second leg instantly—guard drops.

##### Resolution / Aftermath
Ilyas stands—hands in pockets. Grinning.

Ilyas: “Too Dependant Of Magic I see, that makes this much easier.”

He claps once—Focused Nullification surges. All non-slaves collapse unconscious—mana-dependent bodies shut down. Hall falls silent except slave breathing.

Ilyas (to slaves): “All done, Free at last.”

He proceeds—breaks remaining collars. Reassures Akane. Tells slaves to leave kingdom, seek villages (mention him & cheetah lady). Asks who wants to drop bodies in river (already done). Akane stays. Others depart gratefully.

- Ilyas: “Magic Is Overatted.” — (calm dismissal of volley)
- Ilyas: “Plot Twist. This Place Is Mine...” — (ownership reveal)

- **Tone/Atmosphere:** Sudden, absolute reversal — silence after chaos

#### Pre-Scene Context
Ilyas has breached window, nullified initial attacks, thrown Veyris & head slaver, dodged guards. Declared ownership. Asked slave count—Akane answered 23. Oppressors recovering, charging again with blades. Stakes: total liberation vs recapture. Ilyas knows he can exclude slaves from effect.

#### Full Scene Narration

##### Opening Beat
Ilyas nods at count.

Ilyas (calm): “Twenty Three.. Heavy price, but not worry, can handle all in....”

Closes eyes—then opens them. Void intensifies—rings spin to head, trails/clones multiply faster.

##### Progression — Turn 1
Single clap—sharp echo. Void ripples outward—invisible but lethal to mana.

Guards collapse—swords clatter, armor thuds. Slavers drop—blades fall. Guests slump mid-flight—silk tears on marble.

##### Climax / Peak Moment
Veyris staggers—knees buckle, slumps against wall. Head slaver crumples atop him. Hall falls silent except slave breathing.

Ilyas (calm, grinning): “Now. Much Better.”

##### Resolution / Aftermath
Ilyas claps hands together—finishes gesture. All non-slaves unconscious. Slaves stand—collars inert. Freedom begins.
