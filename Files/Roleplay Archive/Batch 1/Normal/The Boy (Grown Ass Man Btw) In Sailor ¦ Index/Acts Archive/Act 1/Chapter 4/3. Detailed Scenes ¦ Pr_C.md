  - Ilyas Sokara — Protagonist, nullifier, swallowed victim
  - Claire Chevalier — Mentor/love interest, fellow victim

#### Pre-Scene Context
Ilyas left mansion at dawn for groceries after preparing perfect breakfast (miso, grilled fish, rice, natto, flowers). Akane & Yuki still eating inside. Village raid by thugs → Ilyas nullifies magic casually, walks through looking goofy, clones trailing. Massive one-eyed curse beast appears — swallows everything. Ilyas tries Nullification Zero redirect but exhausted (overuse past 4 days + early wake-up). Gets inhaled. Inside: ruined floating cityscape in viscous glowing fluids. Claire already there — pushed villagers out of way, got dragged in herself. Disgusted, clinging to Ilyas for stability.

#### Full Scene Narration

**Opening Beat**  
Ilyas stands ankle-deep in glowing mucus, looking around calmly.  
“ How... Do i get lost so easily... Every Single time. „  
“ I wasn't even Walking into this direction, and Now Inside an Curse's Body, And An Annoying Hot Chick beside me. „  
He stretches arms upward, lays back on viscous ground — hair soaked, leg crossed over the other, completely unbothered.

**Progression — Turn 1**  
Claire (dripping, disgusted, accent thick) clings to his arm.  
“Mon… mon petit chat? C’est vraiment toi? Tu… tu as grandi, hein? Toujours aussi mignon dans ce petit uniforme trempé…”  
She blinks hard — accent snaps back.  
“Ilyas… how did *you* end up in here? And why do you look so… unbothered? This place is revolting.”

**Progression — Turn 2**  
Ilyas grins softly, eyes opening.  
“Quite the Visit state, Maman chat!. „  
“And how i ended up here... Well. Grocery Run, and when Tried to Get it down... MY energy betrayed me, and stayed there to be sucked in...”  
He sits up, stretches.  
“But Worry Not, Once my energy Comes Back, i am turning this entire thing Down.. „  
“But I am Not the only One Who Grew, You look like a Certified Milf Now, Hehe.”

**Progression — Turn 3**  
Claire flushes, accent slipping.  
“M-Maman Chat… tu oses encore m’appeler comme ça, petit insolent…?”  
Bonks his head lightly — hand lingers in hair.  
“Grocery run. Of course. Only *you* would treat being swallowed by a city-eating curse like forgetting your shopping list at home.”

**Progression — Turn 4**  
Ilyas grins, flustered at contact.  
“You’re Pressing.. „  
“Too.. Much... Never mind.”  
Coughs breathlessly.  
“Like i said, We can Either wait here until i Charge. „  
“Or.. Go inside further.. Your choice.”

**Progression — Turn 5**  
Claire teases back, accent thick.  
“P-press… too much? Mon Dieu, petit chat, you’re the one who’s… *solid* now…”  
Releases sleeve, crosses arms (cleavage higher in soaked blouse).  
“Waiting sounds… safe. Boring. But safe. Going deeper means risking more of *this*—”  
Gestures at dripping surroundings.  
“But if you say you can turn it inside-out once you’re charged… I trust you. Always have.”

**Progression — Turn 6**  
Ilyas nods.  
“Well... If my Calculations Are accurate.. Or close to. „  
“I Do Need bigger Capacity becoming ^because this curse is massive.... „  
“and Probably Have To Charge for like an Hour... Since I Used My Curse Too Much in the last Four Days.”  
Giggling sheepishly.  
“and also When Going to get groceries. They were like a big Fight, i just stepped in, and energy Slowly Draining just to look cool and be lazy about it.”

**Progression — Turn 7**  
Claire cups his cheek — thumb brushes droplet from jaw.  
“Sixty minutes… fine. We wait. But you do *not* move from this spot, understand?”  
Thumb lingers.  
“And while we wait… you will tell Maman Chat exactly how many times you’ve nearly gotten yourself killed in the last four days showing off like that.”

**Progression — Turn 8**  
Ilyas not resisting — ragdolls into Claire’s grip.  
“Anyways. What is your name, ghost lady?. „  
“Or Should we Create you a New Nickname ???”

**Progression — Turn 9**  
Claire grips hair tighter — drags him toward bathroom.  
“Name later. Bathroom now. You smell like death marinated in fish sauce.”  
Glances at Pink.  
“And you — stop bouncing like that. You’re making the hallway look like a bad hentai panel.”

**Progression — Turn 10**  
Pink squeaks — breasts bounce harder.  
“I-I’m trying!! It just… happens when I’m nervous!! Ehehe… sorry…!”

**Progression — Turn 11**  
Claire kicks bathroom door open — drags Ilyas inside.  
“In. Shower. Now. I’m washing this idiot myself before the smell becomes permanent.”  
Looks at doorway.  
“All of you. Towels. Hot water. Soap. Lots of soap. Pink — follow. You’re getting scrubbed too.”

**Climax / Peak Moment**  
Claire strips to bra & panties — practical modesty. Washes Pink first — gentle soapy hands on translucent shoulders. Shifts to Ilyas — notices hard outline through soaked underwear → cups through fabric → slips inside → direct grip & stroking. Pink watches — aroused, nipples throbbing — begins self-touching. Claire rides him — slow → hard → mutual climax (filled deeply twice).

**Resolution / Aftermath**  
Claire collapses atop Ilyas — still inside — arms locked, sobbing tears of long-awaited love. Pink presses to his side — solidified limbs clinging — shimmering tears falling from being chosen. All three tangled — quiet sobs, shaky breaths calming into clinging silence.

## Notes & Observations

### Narrative Techniques Used
- Dual simultaneous scenes (bathroom intimacy vs hallway eavesdropping)
- Contrasting tones (raw emotion inside vs comedic tears outside)
- Sensory escalation (slime → steam → tears)

### Unusual Elements
- Akane crying (blamed on “cum particles”)
- Pink solidifying fully for first time

### Archival Challenges
- Balancing explicit intimacy with emotional depth
- Capturing dual-scene parallelism without breaking chronology

### Future Reference Points
- Claire’s breeding intent → possible pregnancy arc
- Pink’s solidification → future combat/utility potential
- Akane/Yuki’s “cuddle ambush” plan → next chapter convergence
