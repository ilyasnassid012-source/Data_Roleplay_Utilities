# Act I — Chapter 4 — Lore & Memories — The Boy Who Collects Broken Things

## Lore

### SHATTERED Veil Cosmology (Core World Rule)
#### Meta-Data
- Type: Absolute System Rule
- Scope: Global
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Timeless
- Canon Level: Absolute

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: All magic-users of sufficient tier (Claire knows fragments, Akane & Yuki know surface level)
- Unknown To: General population, low-tier mages
- Discoverable By: High-tier exposure, forbidden texts, direct confrontation with high-level curses/entities

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Magic practitioners, curse bearers, nullifiers (especially Ilyas)
- Indirectly Affected: Entire societal structure (magic inequality, curse outbreaks)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
The world is layered beneath a fractured "veil" — a metaphysical membrane separating baseline reality from higher-dimensional curse energies. When the veil weakens, curses manifest physically. Nullification (Ilyas's power) does not destroy curse energy — it collapses it back through the veil temporarily. Overuse causes exhaustion because the user is forcing reality to reject something that wants to exist. Large-scale curses (like the one-eyed whale) are not alive in the conventional sense — they are breaches wearing flesh.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Nullification cannot permanently erase curses — only delay/redirect
- Possession of large entities (curse beasts) requires immense spiritual stamina and risks backlash
- Veil breaches scale with emotional despair / societal decay

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Explains why Ilyas was exhausted despite casual null use earlier
- Justifies Pink’s successful large-scale possession (ghost nature bypasses some physical limits)
- Sets up future risk: repeated large breaches could thin the veil permanently in the region

### The Boy’s Cursed Physique (Character-Specific Rule)
#### Meta-Data
- Type: Character-specific Forbidden Knowledge
- Scope: Character-specific (Ilyas only)
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Since childhood (implied)
- Canon Level: Absolute

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Ilyas (fully), Claire (suspects strongly), Pink (discovered this chapter)
- Unknown To: Akane, Yuki (suspect but not confirmed)
- Discoverable By: Direct testing (as Pink did)

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Ilyas, anyone attempting to possess/influence him magically
- Indirectly Affected: Potential possessors (Pink learned the hard way)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Ilyas’s body is not merely a nullifier — it is cursed at a fundamental level to reject external control. Magic, possession, even spiritual influence cannot take root without explicit consent. This is why Pink’s possession attempt “bounced off like water on oil.” It is not just anti-magic — it is anti-ownership. He can be physically overwhelmed or restrained, but never dominated metaphysically.

#### Rules & Constraints
- No external entity (ghost, curse, magic) can possess or control without permission
- Consent must be conscious & willing (sleeping possession theoretically possible but untested)
- Physical force still works — only metaphysical domination is blocked

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Confirmed by Pink’s failed possession attempt
- Reinforces Ilyas’s agency — no one can “take” him
- Allows safe inclusion of powerful but potentially dangerous allies (e.g. Pink)

## Memories

### Claire’s Long Wait (Personal / Shared Trauma)
#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal + Shared
- Emotional Weight: Extreme
- Reliability: Accurate (core truth)
- Time Reference: Since Ilyas was 12 (forest alley meeting)

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Claire (primary), Ilyas (partial)
- Witnessed By: None
- Remembered By: Claire (vivid), Ilyas (faded fragments)
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Claire (guilt, longing, pride)
- Emotional Bias: Nostalgia, guilt, aching love

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Claire remembers the day she first saw 12-year-old Ilyas in tattered child-sized sailor uniform, eating cold beans surrounded by fleeing slavers. She did not approach — only watched. She left parcels (blanket, food, medical kit) anonymously. Watched him survive. Later mentored him, fed him, mended his uniform late at night. Almost-moment at age 21 (rain-soaked, hand on hers, whispered name) — she stepped back. Then prison — three years of helplessness. He never visited after release — only sent freed slaves to her village. She waited. Always waited.

#### Consequences
- Deep possessive love masked as mentorship
- Chronic guilt for not confessing sooner
- Fierce protectiveness — nearly died saving villagers to reach him

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Triggered full confession in afterglow
- Drives her plea: “Don’t leave me again… even sometimes…”
- Sets up future tension: will he stay more often?

### Pink’s Unseen Years (Personal Trauma)
#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal / Fragmented
- Emotional Weight: High
- Reliability: Fragmented (she “forgot” much)
- Time Reference: Since death (1–2 years ago)

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Pink (primary)
- Witnessed By: None
- Remembered By: Pink (painfully)
- Forgotten By: Pink (large portions)

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Pink (loneliness, invisibility)
- Emotional Bias: Desperate need to be seen

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Pink died (details forgotten/suppressed). Became ghost. Watched Ilyas exit prison. Followed. Saw him save Akane. Shelter Yuki. Build a home. Watched every fight, every laugh, every gentle touch. Never approached — terrified of rejection or being unseen again. Waited to be noticed. Was never noticed. Until today.

#### Consequences
- Obsessive watching → deep emotional attachment
- Fear of being discarded → clinging behavior
- Joy at being seen → immediate loyalty

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Triggered tearful begging to stay
- Drives her to solidify & cling physically
- Sets up future need for constant reassurance

### Akane & Yuki’s Realization (Shared Awakening)
#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Shared / Recent
- Emotional Weight: Medium-High
- Reliability: Accurate
- Time Reference: This chapter (eavesdropping)

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Akane & Yuki
- Witnessed By: None
- Remembered By: Akane & Yuki
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Akane (dominant), Yuki (emotional)
- Emotional Bias: Guilt, love, acceptance

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Overheard moans → “breed me” → tearful confessions. Realized Ilyas doesn’t collect girls for sex/boobies — he finds broken people and gives them home, safety, love. Remembered yesterday’s threesome — felt real care too. Felt like villains for planning blackmail. Decided to leave them alone today.

#### Consequences
- Shift from possessive greed → willingness to share & grow family
- Softened future teasing plans — more loving ambush
- Akane blames “cum particles” for tears (comedic deflection)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Chose not to interrupt — left towels & retreated
- Sets up tomorrow’s inclusion attempt
- Deepened bond with Ilyas’s purpose
