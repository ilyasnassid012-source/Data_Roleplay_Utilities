# Act I Chapter 3 — Lore & Memories — Riverside Reunion & Frost Awakening

## Lore

### The Hidden Master's Curse Entity
#### Meta-Data
- Type: Forbidden Knowledge / Ancient Curse
- Scope: Regional (Kingdom outskirts & beyond) → potentially global if uncontained
- Status: Active (contained/sealed)
- Time Period: Ancient (pre-Ilyas imprisonment) → Ongoing cycle
- Canon Level: Absolute (confirmed by Ilyas' past encounter)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By:
  - Ilyas (direct past encounter & sealing)
  - Hidden Master / Curse itself
  - Possibly ancient curse scholars or high-rank demonologists (rumored)
- Unknown To:
  - General population
  - Akane (unaware of details)
  - Yuki (no knowledge)
- Discoverable By:
  - Direct combat with vessel
  - Possession attempt observation
  - Access to Ilyas' basement seal collection

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected:
  - Ilyas (past victim/sealer)
  - Yuki (targeted for possession)
  - Festival participants (used as bait)
- Indirectly Affected:
  - Kingdom nobility (corruption bait)
  - Future harem members (potential targets)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
The Hidden Master is an ancient body-stealing curse entity that possesses hosts, uses them to feed on human greed/corruption, and discards them when compromised. It ran the Slave Festival as a long-term trap — not for profit, but to expose and harvest moral decay. Ilyas previously sealed it in an apple years ago (pre-prison); someone ate the apple, restarting the cycle. This chapter, it took a new stitched-face vessel, spawned shadow clones, attempted to possess Yuki when losing — Ilyas sealed it into an onion using reversed nullification pull.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Cannot be directly nullified (cursed nature bypasses Ilyas' null)
- Requires living host vessel
- Can spawn shadow constructs
- Possession via black threads (fast, silent)
- Sealing via layered containment (fruit/vegetable) — temporary, not permanent

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Politics: Festival destruction may spark investigation or power vacuum
- Combat: Shadow clones vulnerable to frost + inverted null synergy
- Powers: Yuki’s frost awakening directly counters curse vessel
- NPC behavior: Survivors will spread tales of “sailor boy & fox girl” destroying festival
- World state: Curse contained — threat dormant but not eliminated

### Yuki’s Frost Affinity Suppression Collar
#### Meta-Data
- Type: System Rule / Artifact
- Scope: Character-specific (Yuki)
- Status: Resolved (destroyed)
- Time Period: Lifelong (since kit-hood) → Ended this chapter
- Canon Level: Absolute (confirmed by collar destruction & power surge)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By:
  - Yuki (lived experience)
  - Festival slavers & Hidden Master (used it)
  - Ilyas (destroyed it)
- Unknown To:
  - Akane (unaware of details)
- Discoverable By:
  - Direct observation of Yuki pre/post collar

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected:
  - Yuki (no frost use, constant numbness)
- Indirectly Affected:
  - Ilyas (gained frost synergy partner)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Lifelong collar locked Yuki’s three-tailed snow fox-kin frost potential since birth — preventing use or even sensation of cold/heat extremes. Destroyed by Ilyas via null touch + strength. Result: immediate uncontrolled frost surge → gradual conscious control.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Collar nullifies innate racial magic
- Removal restores full potential
- Long suppression causes sensory overload upon release

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Combat: Yuki now active frost wielder (spears, area control)
- Personality: Growing confidence & agency
- Relationships: Deepens bond with Ilyas (liberator) & Akane (sister figure)

## Memories

### Ilyas vs Hidden Master — First Sealing (Pre-Prison)
#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal (Ilyas)
- Emotional Weight: Medium (old frustration + satisfaction)
- Reliability: Accurate (direct experience)
- Time Reference: Years ago, pre-imprisonment

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Ilyas
- Witnessed By: None (solo encounter)
- Remembered By: Ilyas
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas
- Emotional Bias: Lingering irritation at failed permanent seal

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas lived casually in his mansion when a female voice lured him outside. It was the curse possessing a woman’s body — trap set. Fight lasted an hour (Ilyas less skilled then). He sealed it into an apple using improvised method. Misplaced the apple; someone ate it → cycle restarted. Memory resurfaces when recognizing stitched forehead.

#### Consequences
- Motivation to improve null mastery
- Wariness of body-stealing curses
- Basement seal collection started

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Immediate recognition of Hidden Master
- Use of improved onion seal method
- Protective instinct toward Yuki (targeted by same curse)

### Yuki’s Collar Destruction & First Frost
#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Shared (Yuki primary)
- Emotional Weight: Extreme (liberation trauma & ecstasy)
- Reliability: Accurate (vivid sensory overload)
- Time Reference: Midday festival battle

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Yuki (primary), Ilyas (active)
- Witnessed By: Festival crowd (briefly), Hidden Master
- Remembered By: Yuki, Ilyas
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Yuki
- Emotional Bias: Overwhelming gratitude, awe, attachment to Ilyas

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Yuki remembers cage, collar numbness, tails bound. Ilyas calls her “Snowdin” — first non-slave name. Lock shatters. Collar nullified & broken. First real cold/heat sensation floods in — tails flare, frost explodes uncontrollably. Helps Ilyas fight shadow clones. Thread possession attempt — terror of re-chaining. Ilyas intercepts at last second.

#### Consequences
- Instant loyalty & romantic/sexual choice of Ilyas
- Fear of re-collaring → deep trust in him
- Pride in helping him (synergy)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Openly chooses Ilyas (“Yuki chooses Snowdin-Chan”)
- Comfortable nudity & intimacy with Akane
- Desire for group intimacy with Ilyas (asks about gang scenario)

### Akane’s Morning After Reflection
#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal (Akane)
- Emotional Weight: High (relief + longing)
- Reliability: Accurate
- Time Reference: Morning of chapter start

#### Participants
- Experienced By: Akane
- Witnessed By: None
- Remembered By: Akane
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Akane
- Emotional Bias: Fondness, lingering arousal, quiet guilt over past failures

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Akane alone cleaning mansion after intense night with Ilyas. Smells of sex still linger. Reflects on his return — “he’s really back… not leaving again”. Fantasizes about future harem additions — sees herself as protective big sister, not maternal. Gentle possessiveness toward Ilyas.

#### Consequences
- Instant acceptance of Yuki (no jealousy)
- Enthusiastic support for group scenarios
- Deepened loyalty to Ilyas

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Welcomes Yuki warmly
- Shamelessly shares sex details with Yuki
- Joins Yuki in fantasizing group night with Ilyas
