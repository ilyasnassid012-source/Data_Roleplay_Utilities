- **Duration:** \~8–10 minutes (real-time combat pacing)
- **POV(s):** Ilyas primary, Yuki secondary (internal awakening focus)
- **Tone/Atmosphere:** Chaotic frenzy → stunned silence → explosive release

#### Pre-Scene Context
Ilyas has wandered into the festival while evading a curse-beast. Crowd is betting on his survival. Yuki is caged — collared, tails bound, malnourished, frost potential suppressed since birth. Ilyas walks directly to her cage, ignoring nobles/guards/announcer. Stakes: Yuki’s freedom vs re-enslavement or possession.

**Character States Entering:**
- **Ilyas:** Calm, transformed, groceries in hand, null-zone ready, intent to liberate
- **Yuki:** Numb, hopeless, tails twitching weakly, collar burning
- **Hidden Master:** Watching from shadows, amused, not yet engaged

#### Full Scene Narration

##### Opening Beat
Ilyas stops at Yuki’s silver-barred cage. Hand rests on lock.  
He speaks softly:  
“Snowdin.”

Yuki’s ears twitch — first time hearing anything but “slave” or “pet”. One tail tip slips silk binding for half-second before collar yanks it back. Her ice-blue eyes lift slowly.

##### Progression — Turn 1
Ilyas’s fingers tighten. Cursed Physique surges — muscles flex under sailor fabric.  
**CRACK!** Lock shatters like glass. Door swings wide.  
Crowd gasps collectively. Announcer screams into mic:  
“HE BROKE THE LOCK! THE FOX IS FREE!!”

Yuki doesn’t move. Body trembles — not cold, but overload of possibility.

##### Progression — Turn 2
Ilyas kneels slightly. Fingers hover over glowing collar.  
Nullification Touch — single fingertip contact.  
Glow dies instantly. Magic input/output severed.  
Collar becomes inert metal.

Ilyas grips both sides — pulls.  
**SNAP!** Collar breaks in two. Pieces clatter to dirt.

##### Progression — Turn 3 (Awakening Surge)
Yuki convulses once — not pain, but sensation flood.  
First real cold rushes in. Heat follows. Everything at once.  
Tails explode outward — silk shreds completely.  
Blue light sparks at tips. Frost spiderwebs across cage bars from her touch.

Yuki’s voice cracks — first words post-collar:  
“…c-cold… real… cold…”

##### Progression — Turn 4 (Crowd Reaction)
Announcer loses mind:  
“THE COLLAR IS GONE! THE FOX IS AWAKE! FROST IS SPREADING!”

Guards charge — spears raised.  
Frost races outward — boots freeze mid-step. Guards locked in ice mid-stride.

##### Climax / Peak Moment
Hidden Master steps from pavilion shadows — stitched mask, black robes breathing.  
Voice cuts through chaos:  
“Enough.”

Pressure wave — frost halts mid-air for half-second.

Yuki’s tails flare like frozen wings. First controlled frost spear forms in her shaking hand.

##### Resolution / Aftermath
Ilyas stands between Yuki & Master.
