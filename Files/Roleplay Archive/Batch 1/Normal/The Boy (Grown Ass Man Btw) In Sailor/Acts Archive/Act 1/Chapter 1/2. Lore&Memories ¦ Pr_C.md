# Act I — Chapter 1 — The Boy (Grown Ass Man Btw) In Sailor — Lore & Memories

## Lore

### Ironbelly Depths (Sealed Dominion Mirror-Realm Prison)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Public Knowledge / System Rule
- Scope: Global (Dominion-controlled prison network)
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Ongoing (centuries established)
- Canon Level: Absolute

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: All Dominion citizens, prisoners, most non-humans (as threat), Warden & guards
- Unknown To: Few outside Dominion; some Wild Zone inhabitants believe it's myth
- Discoverable By: Imprisonment, high-rank Dominion clearance, rare escapes

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Prisoners (collared, extended sentences common), Warden (authority), Dominion (control mechanism)
- Indirectly Affected: Non-human populations (constant threat of capture), free villages (refugees from escapes)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Massive underground/mirror-realm prison complex run by Sealed Dominion. Designed to contain non-humans and dissidents indefinitely. Sentences often extended arbitrarily; release extremely rare. Warden holds near-absolute power but follows Dominion protocols. Collars suppress magic/mana for most inmates.

#### Rules & Constraints
- No true release without Warden/Dominion sign-off
- Collars nullify mana-based abilities (curses sometimes exempt)
- Escapes trigger Dominion hunter response
- "Loose threads" (released prisoners) monitored

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Ilyas's genuine release sets precedent (unusual, suspicious)
- Warden's operative offer refused → potential future conflict
- Prison reputation reinforces human supremacy

### Veyris Mansion (Ilyas's Hidden River Home)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Character-specific / Hidden Truth
- Scope: Personal / Regional
- Status: Reclaimed (previously usurped)
- Time Period: Recent (usurped during Ilyas's imprisonment)
- Canon Level: Absolute (to Ilyas & Akane)

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Ilyas (owner), Akane (stayed to protect), Veyris (usurper, now unconscious)
- Unknown To: Dominion, most outsiders, party guests/slavers
- Discoverable By: Deed records, Ilyas's testimony, future investigation

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Ilyas (reclaimed), Akane (failed protector), Veyris (displaced)
- Indirectly Affected: 23 freed slaves (party site), Dominion (missing noble)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Hidden mansion by river, paid/maintained by Ilyas during imprisonment to remain untouched. Veyris usurped it for depraved slave parties (collars, prototypes). Ilyas discovered during release walk, violently reclaimed it, nullified magic, freed slaves, disposed of oppressors in river.

#### Rules & Constraints
- Warded/secret location
- No public deed trail (rent-free arrangement)
- River proximity (deep/fast current used for disposal)

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Mansion now Ilyas's again (broken window remains)
- Veyris & party members lost downstream → potential revenge/recovery
- Akane stays; remaining slaves departed

### Safe Non-Human Villages (Outside Kingdom Borders)

#### Meta-Data
- Type: Public Knowledge (among non-humans)
- Scope: Regional
- Status: Active
- Time Period: Ongoing
- Canon Level: Reliable

#### Knowledge & Awareness
- Known By: Non-humans, escapees, some smugglers
- Unknown To: Most humans/Dominion
- Discoverable By: Escape, rumor, direct travel

#### Affected Parties
- Directly Affected: Freed slaves (22 departed), cheetah lady (gatekeeper)
- Indirectly Affected: Ilyas (contact point)

#### Main Narrative / Explanation
Scattered hidden villages beyond Dominion reach for non-humans. Protected, self-governing. Entry requires vouching (e.g., Ilyas's name + cheetah lady contact).

#### Rules & Constraints
- Humans generally barred
- Vouchsafe needed for entry
- Safe haven from collars/hunters

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- 22 freed slaves en route
- Potential future ally network for Ilyas

## Memories

### Akane's Capture While Asleep

#### Meta-Data
- Memory Type: Personal / Traumatizing

- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Akane
- Emotional Bias: Guilt, shame, self-blame

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Akane kept returning to mansion despite initial refusal (felt safe). Fell into deep sleep as usual. Slavers entered undetected, collared her off-guard. She awoke already captive, unable to fight. Believes she failed to protect the place for Ilyas.

#### Consequences
- Deep guilt/shame
- Reinforced trust in Ilyas (rescuer multiple times)
- Hesitation to leave mansion again

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)

- Motivation to stay/help Ilyas

- Reliability: Accurate
- Time Reference: Past 4 years

#### Participants

- Remembered By: Ilyas, Warden (knew of him)
- Forgotten By: None

#### Perspective & Bias
- Primary Perspective: Ilyas
- Emotional Bias: Detached acceptance, mild annoyance

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas voluntarily imprisoned (father's signature). Served full term without extensions (unusual). Protected sailor suit identity throughout. Declined Warden's operative offer upon release.

#### Consequences

- Emotional Bias: Shame (Akane), casual reassurance (Ilyas)

#### Main Narrative / Recollection
Ilyas told Akane she could stay if she wanted despite her refusal. She kept returning anyway (felt safe). Deep sleeper habit allowed capture when slavers entered.

#### Consequences
- Akane's guilt over "failure"
- Strengthened bond with Ilyas
- Decision to stay after liberation

#### Current Impact (Today’s Effect)
- Akane's big-sister teasing returning
- Comfortable domestic silence
