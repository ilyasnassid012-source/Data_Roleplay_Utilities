## Timeline
### Main Flow

**OPENING CONTEXT:**
Ilyas Sokara, imprisoned for 4 years in Ironbelly Depths (Sealed Dominion mirror-realm), is genuinely released by the Warden after declining an operative recruitment offer. He reaffirms his role protecting the sailor suit (both inside and outside prison) and his existing place to return to. The world outside remains human-supremacist with collars, enslaved non-humans, Wild Zones, and Dominion eyes watching loose threads. No tricks or extensions—freedom is real, but dangerous.

#### Scene 1 — Warden's Office Release
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary), Warden (observing)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Warden (present)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Afternoon → late afternoon
- **Scene Type:** Dialogue-Heavy, Decision Point

**Narrative:**
Ilyas sits opposite the Warden, arms crossed, empty milk carton discarded. He calmly refuses the Warden's offer to become a world-fixing operative, asserting lifelong guardianship of his sailor suit and a place to return to. The Warden accepts without pressure—parchment signed, genuine release confirmed. No escort, no collar. Door opens outward. Warden warns: Dominion will see him as a loose thread. Ilyas takes the document and leaves.

#### Scene 2 — Coastal Path to Saltharbor
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Old Fisherman (warning), Smuggler Group (murmuring)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late afternoon
- **Scene Type:** Exploration, World-Building

**Narrative:**
Ilyas walks the salt-crusted path, breathing fresh air after years of prison damp. Mutters navigation ("3 Nebula stars South" or perpendicular to sun). Old Fisherman warns of wolves and gives star advice. Smugglers gossip about "Violet" who walked out of the belly without collar. Village smoke rises—Saltharbor ahead. Eyes follow the sailor suit.

#### Scene 3 — Path Fork & Nobles' Laughter
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Higher-Rank Nobles (laughing about Veyris mansion party)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Dusk falling
- **Scene Type:** Foreshadowing, Discovery

**Narrative:**
Path splits—left to village, right into woods toward mountains. Nobles laugh about Veyris's slave party at hidden river mansion (collars, prototypes, depravity). Ilyas realizes it's his own home—paid to protect while imprisoned. Fury masked, he walks right, bumps nobles (solid physique staggers them), mutters about host learning to swim.

#### Scene 4 — Window Breach & Party Disruption
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), Veyris (host), Head Slaver, party guests, slaves (bound)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Moonrise
- **Scene Type:** Action, Liberation

**Narrative:**
Ilyas throws unconscious nobles through grand hall window. Heads in, mocks absent guards ("But Nobody Came"). Declares ownership ("This place is mine"). Slavers laugh → charge with firebolts → attacks fizzle in Nullification Zone. Ilyas walks forward unharmed, aura voiding (hollow eyes, void hair/skin, anchor rings, trails/clones). Throws Veyris and head slaver, dodges guards (collide/kick down). Commands no escape, cleanup. Asks slave count → Akane answers "twenty-three." Claps → Focused Nullification collapses all non-slaves unconscious.

#### Scene 5 — Liberation & Departure
- **Character's Povs:** Ilyas (primary)
- **Characters Present/Knows:** Ilyas (present), 23 freed slaves (including Akane)
- **Approximate Time Range:** Late night → early morning
- **Scene Type:** Catharsis, Resolution

**Narrative:**
Ilyas breaks collars—Akane first, then all 23. Reassures Akane (not her fault, deep sleeper, unfair capture). Tells slaves to leave kingdom, seek non-human villages (mention Ilyas & cheetah lady). Offers river body drop (bodies already in water). Akane stays; others depart with gratitude. Ilyas finishes cleanup.

#### Ending/Outcome

**CLOSING CONTEXT:**
Mansion quiet—oppressors struggling downstream in river. 22 slaves en route to safety. Akane remains. Ilyas cooks breakfast after years of slop. Akane dozes on couch—deep sleeper as ever. Sun rises. Home reclaimed. New day begins.

##### Overall Consequences
- Ilyas free after 4 years, reclaims hidden mansion
- Veyris's party destroyed; oppressors humiliated in river
- 23 slaves liberated (collars broken, free to flee)
- Akane stays with Ilyas (guilt easing, sibling-like bond reaffirmed)
- World outside remains dangerous (Dominion eyes, human supremacy)

##### Unresolved Threads
- River survivors (Veyris et al.) may seek revenge/recovery
- Dominion notice of missing high-rank noble + prison escapee
- Akane's future (guilt, deep-sleep vulnerability, relationship with Ilyas)
- Safe villages & cheetah lady contact (will 22 arrive safely?)
- Mansion security (broken window, potential trackers)

##### Relationships Update
- Ilyas & Akane: Deepened trust + sibling dynamic; she stays despite guilt
- Ilyas & freed slaves: Gratitude & loyalty (promise to return if needed)
- Ilyas & Veyris: Direct enmity (thrown into river, home stolen)
- Akane & mansion: Failed protector → welcomed resident

## Reminders
### Pending Confrontations
- Veyris & survivors vs Ilyas (potential revenge arc)
- Dominion hunters vs escaped "loose thread" Ilyas

### Missions / Choices Made
- Declined Warden operative offer → genuine freedom
- Chose to reclaim home violently → liberated 23 slaves
- Directed slaves to safety → Akane stayed

- **[Unusual Behavior]:** Akane's deep sleep returns immediately after trauma
- **[Continuity Concern]:** River survivors may return with reinforcements
- **[Meta / OOC Impact]:** Chapter ends on quiet domestic note after violence
